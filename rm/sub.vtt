00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.690
- Hello. - Hi.

2
00:00:08.692 --> 00:00:11.760
2019 New Year Project,

3
00:00:11.762 --> 00:00:13.390
- Level Up Race. - Yes.

4
00:00:13.397 --> 00:00:17.235
- Congratulations on your winning. - Yes.

5
00:00:17.334 --> 00:00:18.360
Who will it be?

6
00:00:18.368 --> 00:00:21.800
(At the random roulette to reach the highest level from last race...)

7
00:00:21.805 --> 00:00:23.300
(Kim Jong Kook and Song Ji Hyo)

8
00:00:23.306 --> 00:00:27.770
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo were chosen.)

9
00:00:27.778 --> 00:00:31.480
(The winners must decide if they'll use SBS' corporate card,)

10
00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:34.115
(their reward, together or not.)

11
00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:37.220
On the cards...

12
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.750
(The time to decide has come at last.)

13
00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:42.650
"Alone" and "together" are written.

14
00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:45.995
- If both of you choose "together", - Yes.

15
00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.495
each of you will get to spend half of the credit limit.

16
00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:51.800
If both of you choose to spend it alone,

17
00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:54.630
you will go through a match, and only the winner...

18
00:00:54.638 --> 00:00:56.470
will get to spend the money on his or her own.

19
00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:57.940
- Only one of us will get it? - Yes.

20
00:00:57.941 --> 00:01:00.770
However, if one of you chooses to spend it together...

21
00:01:00.777 --> 00:01:03.540
and the other chooses to spend it alone,

22
00:01:03.547 --> 00:01:05.810
only the one who chose to spend it alone will get the reward.

23
00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:06.910
Goodness.

24
00:01:06.917 --> 00:01:08.110
(The one who chose to spend it alone will get the reward.)

25
00:01:08.118 --> 00:01:10.280
Okay. I got it.

26
00:01:10.287 --> 00:01:13.320
- Well... Okay. - Think very carefully.

27
00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:14.690
(But Jong Kook, do you remember?)

28
00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:15.950
I will think carefully about it.

29
00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:17.620
(But Jong Kook, do you remember?)

30
00:01:17.627 --> 00:01:21.725
(We were so happy then.)

31
00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:24.430
Then we will check the cards now.

32
00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:25.700
(Yes, Ji Hyo. We won because we were together.)

33
00:01:25.702 --> 00:01:28.270
1, 2...

34
00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:29.900
(What will happen to them and the prize money?)

35
00:01:29.906 --> 00:01:30.900
Three.

36
00:01:30.907 --> 00:01:33.005
(What will happen to them and the prize money?)

37
00:01:33.577 --> 00:01:35.205
Here.

38
00:01:35.445 --> 00:01:37.980
(Jong Kook chooses to spend the money alone.)

39
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:40.950
(Ji Hyo also chooses to spend it alone.)

40
00:01:40.951 --> 00:01:42.210
"Alone"?

41
00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:43.520
- What did you choose? - "Alone".

42
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.580
You also chose to spend it alone.

43
00:01:45.589 --> 00:01:48.220
- Hey, I couldn't let you take it. - You chose the same card.

44
00:01:48.225 --> 00:01:49.920
- I was thinking the same. - By the way,

45
00:01:49.926 --> 00:01:54.030
I thought that if I chose this "together" card,

46
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.790
I knew that it wouldn't work well for us.

47
00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.700
We need to take a break.

48
00:01:57.701 --> 00:01:59.930
If we decide to spend the money together,

49
00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:01.670
- it would turn out weird. - I got it.

50
00:02:01.671 --> 00:02:03.740
- I thought I should get rid of it. - I got it.

51
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.670
- I'll spend it alone. - Same here.

52
00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:08.240
Since both of you chose to spend it alone,

53
00:02:08.245 --> 00:02:10.580
after going through a match, only one of you will...

54
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.645
- get the entire prize money alone. - Great.

55
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.120
If you were to get the entire prize money alone,

56
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.915
is there anything you'd like to do?

57
00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:22.590
I've been telling you about this for a long time now.

58
00:02:22.592 --> 00:02:23.890
I think...

59
00:02:23.894 --> 00:02:26.955
I have to go to LA.

60
00:02:27.364 --> 00:02:29.290
(The City of Angels everyone dreams of going, LA)

61
00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.130
It's my second hometown which I love very much.

62
00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:35.270
I would like to go there.

63
00:02:35.272 --> 00:02:37.470
Even if we film for 24 hours,

64
00:02:37.474 --> 00:02:39.640
I would welcome it as long as it's in LA.

65
00:02:39.643 --> 00:02:42.945
I would be so happy even if we film for 24 hours.

66
00:02:43.613 --> 00:02:45.380
I want to go to LA.

67
00:02:45.382 --> 00:02:47.075
(His dream and career align.)

68
00:02:47.284 --> 00:02:49.580
(How much does he love LA?)

69
00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:51.215
I also want to...

70
00:02:51.288 --> 00:02:53.750
- experience LA he's talking about. - Why would you go there?

71
00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:56.120
(I want to go to LA too!)

72
00:02:56.126 --> 00:02:57.420
Why would you go to LA?

73
00:02:57.427 --> 00:03:00.690
You've been there many times, but this would be my first time.

74
00:03:00.697 --> 00:03:01.760
You've never been to LA?

75
00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:05.430
- No, I'd like to know about LA. - Really?

76
00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:07.100
I want to experience the city too.

77
00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:09.500
I want to go to LA too!

78
00:03:09.506 --> 00:03:12.505
Goodness, this is weird.

79
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.170
(A few days later)

80
00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:18.010
- Hello. - My goodness.

81
00:03:18.014 --> 00:03:19.710
- Gosh. - Hello.

82
00:03:19.716 --> 00:03:21.050
What's all this?

83
00:03:21.051 --> 00:03:22.580
- Hello. - Gosh, look at this.

84
00:03:22.586 --> 00:03:23.650
Hey, let's sit here.

85
00:03:23.653 --> 00:03:26.120
- What's this? - It smells so good.

86
00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:27.650
Everyone, what you're seeing now...

87
00:03:27.657 --> 00:03:30.090
is a family meal from the South of the US.

88
00:03:30.093 --> 00:03:31.460
I was really hungry.

89
00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:34.730
Everyone, this is a meal...

90
00:03:34.731 --> 00:03:37.000
for the winners of Level Up Race.

91
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.730
(Congratulations on your winning once again.)

92
00:03:39.736 --> 00:03:42.070
- Eat a lot. - Are you buying?

93
00:03:42.072 --> 00:03:43.270
Thank you for the food.

94
00:03:43.273 --> 00:03:44.440
(It's my treat.)

95
00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:46.370
- This is delicious. - Hey, it's good.

96
00:03:46.376 --> 00:03:47.640
This is delicious.

97
00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:49.340
(The exotic flavors fill their mouths.)

98
00:03:49.346 --> 00:03:51.940
(It feels as if they are in the US at the moment.)

99
00:03:51.948 --> 00:03:53.780
- It's good. - It's so good.

100
00:03:53.783 --> 00:03:55.680
I guess I like the food from the South.

101
00:03:55.685 --> 00:03:57.050
(It's perfect for the members.)

102
00:03:57.053 --> 00:03:58.715
This is great.

103
00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:01.820
Did you see what Seok Jin posted on his social media recently?

104
00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:04.890
- What did he upload? - He took a photo with Cha Eun Woo.

105
00:04:04.894 --> 00:04:07.660
- Eun Woo from his radio show? - Yes.

106
00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:10.430
Why did you post that photo? There were other members too.

107
00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:12.160
Should you only mention Eun Woo in the post?

108
00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:13.900
It's not that. I just wrote that,

109
00:04:13.903 --> 00:04:16.800
"Out of all places, I stood next to the handsome guy, Eun Woo."

110
00:04:16.806 --> 00:04:18.040
- That's what I wrote. - I see.

111
00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:20.840
By the way, there's the ugliest guy next to a handsome guy.

112
00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:22.670
- Why am I the ugliest? - Yes, you are.

113
00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:25.680
- The comments are blowing up. - Why?

114
00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:28.110
They wrote that I must have looked great in my young days.

115
00:04:28.118 --> 00:04:31.180
(Why is he suddenly feeling proud of his looks?)

116
00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:33.020
- Really? - No way. We have your photo.

117
00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:35.390
They wrote that they didn't know how small my face was before.

118
00:04:35.392 --> 00:04:36.390
Here it is.

119
00:04:36.393 --> 00:04:39.095
(Providing Seok Jin's photo)

120
00:04:39.396 --> 00:04:41.065
Here it is.

121
00:04:41.498 --> 00:04:44.100
(Given how old it is, the photo shows vivid colors.)

122
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.900
- I can only see his nose. - Hey.

123
00:04:45.902 --> 00:04:48.030
- He was in his 20s. - Where did you get this photo?

124
00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:50.070
- Seok Jin was in his 20s. - I don't even have that photo.

125
00:04:50.073 --> 00:04:52.300
- He was one of a kind. - This is Seok Jin in his 20s.

126
00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:53.610
- What's wrong with you? - He actually looks younger now.

127
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.540
- Doesn't he look better now? - You look younger now.

128
00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:57.110
- Exactly. - He aged very nicely.

129
00:04:57.113 --> 00:04:59.840
Today, we will determine...

130
00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:04.055
the final winner of Level Up Race. It's the Ace versus the Champion.

131
00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:07.120
It's the Ace versus the Champion. It's called La La Land Race.

132
00:05:07.123 --> 00:05:08.190
La La Land?

133
00:05:08.191 --> 00:05:09.920
(La La Land Race will determine the final winner.)

134
00:05:09.926 --> 00:05:12.020
After the match between them,

135
00:05:12.028 --> 00:05:15.260
we will cover all the expenses that will incur...

136
00:05:15.265 --> 00:05:16.860
- during the winner's trip. - Yes!

137
00:05:16.866 --> 00:05:17.860
Really?

138
00:05:17.867 --> 00:05:20.600
As for the rest of the members,

139
00:05:20.603 --> 00:05:24.205
you will listen to Ji Hyo and Jong Kook's trip itineraries to LA.

140
00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:27.510
Pick the team leader with the trip that's more attractive to you.

141
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:28.710
We'll get to choose.

142
00:05:28.712 --> 00:05:29.770
- We'll choose them? - Yes.

143
00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:32.680
- You'll play games together today. - Okay.

144
00:05:32.682 --> 00:05:36.385
The team leader of the winning team...

145
00:05:36.553 --> 00:05:39.220
can go to LA with only one teammate...

146
00:05:39.222 --> 00:05:40.520
of his or her choosing.

147
00:05:40.523 --> 00:05:43.390
Then it would be just the 2 of them, right? Just the 2 of them?

148
00:05:43.393 --> 00:05:45.090
- Just the two of them? - My gosh.

149
00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:46.090
It will be just the two of them?

150
00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:48.260
- If we were to go as a group... - What about three?

151
00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:50.500
Seriously? Isn't this obvious?

152
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.530
No matter who wins, they can pick each other.

153
00:05:52.535 --> 00:05:55.270
(It's bound to be Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.)

154
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:58.670
(This is a conspiracy of cornering them together.)

155
00:05:58.675 --> 00:06:00.945
This is a complete fraud!

156
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:03.380
- Then... - A fraud.

157
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.840
- I was just curious. - Great.

158
00:06:04.848 --> 00:06:08.045
- Interlock your fingers! - Interlock your fingers!

159
00:06:08.218 --> 00:06:10.550
(Kwang Soo gets excited and teases them.)

160
00:06:10.553 --> 00:06:13.455
Kwang Soo, you're making it dusty for our food.

161
00:06:13.923 --> 00:06:15.390
- That was too much. - Okay.

162
00:06:15.392 --> 00:06:16.960
The winner chooses only one person, right?

163
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.625
That's right.

164
00:06:18.762 --> 00:06:20.360
If we want to win, a team with more members will win.

165
00:06:20.363 --> 00:06:21.690
A bigger team will be more advantageous.

166
00:06:21.698 --> 00:06:23.430
But to get picked, a smaller team is better.

167
00:06:23.433 --> 00:06:25.700
(To win, a bigger team is better, but to get picked, vice versa.)

168
00:06:25.702 --> 00:06:28.300
All right. Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.

169
00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:31.170
Please present the itineraries you have prepared.

170
00:06:31.174 --> 00:06:33.640
- Okay. - Start the briefing now.

171
00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:36.370
Why are you going to LA though?

172
00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:38.915
First of all, the weather is great.

173
00:06:38.948 --> 00:06:41.480
It's sunny for 300 days out of 365 days.

174
00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:42.680
It's like deja vu.

175
00:06:42.685 --> 00:06:45.280
When you wake up, it's just like yesterday.

176
00:06:45.288 --> 00:06:46.720
When you wake up again the next day, it's the same day.

177
00:06:46.723 --> 00:06:47.990
(It's nicknamed City of Angels for its weather.)

178
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:49.920
That's true. That's totally true.

179
00:06:49.926 --> 00:06:52.320
- I think I might get bored. - Yes, I agree.

180
00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:53.830
(Trolling from the start)

181
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:54.890
What? No, no.

182
00:06:54.898 --> 00:06:56.330
The weather has to be exciting.

183
00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:58.830
There must be rain, hail, and lightning.

184
00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:00.600
And the sky is very clear.

185
00:07:00.603 --> 00:07:02.470
- I like clouds in the sky. - Shouldn't there be some clouds?

186
00:07:02.472 --> 00:07:04.170
- There should be some clouds. - That's right.

187
00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:05.670
I think it might be boring.

188
00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:08.770
- It should rain and snow. - Do you like clouds?

189
00:07:08.778 --> 00:07:12.840
You should go to London then. Go to London then.

190
00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:13.850
(Go to London if you don't like LA.)

191
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.710
- That would be great then. - How could you say that suddenly?

192
00:07:15.718 --> 00:07:17.980
- My goodness. - Hey, Jong Kook.

193
00:07:17.987 --> 00:07:20.920
You sound very angry. I mean, you're trying to gather members.

194
00:07:20.924 --> 00:07:22.950
- Hear me out. You must hear me out. - Sure, sure.

195
00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:25.190
All right. Here we go. I'll start.

196
00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:28.190
When you land in LA, you'll get hungry no matter what.

197
00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:30.900
The first place we'll go after we land is...

198
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.535
A burger joint?

199
00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:40.505
(What is the first mouthwatering American dish they will have?)

200
00:07:40.677 --> 00:07:42.340
We'll go to Koreatown and have Korean food first.

201
00:07:42.345 --> 00:07:45.740
(The first meal will be Korean food.)

202
00:07:45.748 --> 00:07:47.915
- Soft tofu! - Yes!

203
00:07:48.084 --> 00:07:51.020
- It's amazing. If we eat... - Seafood soft tofu.

204
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.480
American food right away, it'll be hard for us.

205
00:07:52.489 --> 00:07:54.690
The soft tofu place was right next to my lodging.

206
00:07:54.691 --> 00:07:57.320
- Have you had that? - I ate that every day.

207
00:07:57.327 --> 00:08:00.190
- I ate that as soon as I woke up. - Right.

208
00:08:00.196 --> 00:08:03.600
Will we get to eat that soft tofu? Will we get to eat that?

209
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.760
- Of course. - By the way,

210
00:08:05.768 --> 00:08:08.170
I've been to LA with Jong Kook a lot of times.

211
00:08:08.171 --> 00:08:10.030
Korean food in LA is really good.

212
00:08:10.039 --> 00:08:12.100
I mean it. I'm serious.

213
00:08:12.108 --> 00:08:14.610
The best noodles in radish water kimchi...

214
00:08:14.611 --> 00:08:16.670
- I ever had was in LA. - Really?

215
00:08:16.679 --> 00:08:18.880
- Korean food there is exceptional. - Over hundreds of years...

216
00:08:18.882 --> 00:08:21.380
- Gosh, the ribs. - Yes, soft tofu.

217
00:08:21.384 --> 00:08:23.480
- I don't get this. - I'm serious.

218
00:08:23.486 --> 00:08:25.620
We eat Korean food all the time. I don't understand those people...

219
00:08:25.622 --> 00:08:27.890
who eat Korean food on their trips.

220
00:08:27.891 --> 00:08:30.660
Exactly. Some people might react like Seok Jin.

221
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.190
This is the great thing about LA. If you go out of Koreatown,

222
00:08:33.196 --> 00:08:35.990
you can totally feel like you're in a foreign country.

223
00:08:35.999 --> 00:08:38.330
We'll go to the place you want next. It's the baseball stadium.

224
00:08:38.334 --> 00:08:39.730
We must go to the baseball stadium.

225
00:08:39.736 --> 00:08:42.900
Shouldn't we watch LA Dodgers' game?

226
00:08:42.906 --> 00:08:47.110
(Home stadium of LA Dodgers, the prestigious team of MLB)

227
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.140
I'll take you to the game that Ryu Hyun Jin will pitch.

228
00:08:50.146 --> 00:08:54.515
We'll go to the Dodger Stadium and watch their game.

229
00:08:55.151 --> 00:08:57.285
- Is that really possible? - We'll watch their game when we go?

230
00:08:57.687 --> 00:08:59.720
(Having great connections is the Champion's skill too.)

231
00:08:59.722 --> 00:09:02.190
- I do want this one. LA Dodgers. - That sounds fun.

232
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:03.960
Isn't the stadium close to a Korean restaurant?

233
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.190
(Is the Korean restaurant the merit of the trip?)

234
00:09:07.196 --> 00:09:08.890
- Yes, it's close. It's very close. - Right.

235
00:09:08.898 --> 00:09:09.990
- If you... - After the game, you can go there.

236
00:09:09.999 --> 00:09:12.160
- crave kimchi stew, you can go. - Okay.

237
00:09:12.168 --> 00:09:13.730
- That sounds fun. - The baseball stadium sounds fun.

238
00:09:13.736 --> 00:09:15.770
Seok Jin should go. He should go.

239
00:09:15.772 --> 00:09:18.440
After that, we'll head to Santa Monica.

240
00:09:18.441 --> 00:09:19.900
(It doesn't end in LA. They'll visit Santa Monica.)

241
00:09:19.909 --> 00:09:21.470
- The itinerary is great. - Of course.

242
00:09:21.477 --> 00:09:23.840
We'll head over to the beach.

243
00:09:23.846 --> 00:09:25.880
When I said Santa Monica, I meant the beach.

244
00:09:25.882 --> 00:09:27.850
Gosh, the beach.

245
00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:30.085
(The beach exudes the romance of the West Coast.)

246
00:09:30.453 --> 00:09:32.650
Gosh, sashimi from there is really delicious.

247
00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:35.290
(His love for Korean food doesn't end.)

248
00:09:35.291 --> 00:09:37.420
- It's really good. - There's a Korean sashimi place.

249
00:09:37.427 --> 00:09:40.160
- That sashimi place, right? - Yes, that one.

250
00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:41.960
The marinated crabs are great too.

251
00:09:41.965 --> 00:09:44.400
- What is this? - The marinated crabs are great too.

252
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.665
- It's delicious. - Hey.

253
00:09:46.903 --> 00:09:49.200
Will there be other guests on your trip?

254
00:09:49.205 --> 00:09:50.940
- What other guests? - Well...

255
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.500
When we go over there,

256
00:09:52.508 --> 00:09:55.740
I know a lot of healthy and great guys.

257
00:09:55.745 --> 00:09:57.180
- They're younger than you? - Yes.

258
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.110
You desperately want romance...

259
00:09:59.115 --> 00:10:01.410
- in your trip, So Min. - Yes.

260
00:10:01.417 --> 00:10:03.150
It's definitely possible.

261
00:10:03.152 --> 00:10:04.450
There are a lot of guys.

262
00:10:04.454 --> 00:10:06.650
I know a lot of great friends in LA. I'm serious.

263
00:10:06.656 --> 00:10:09.150
He really does know a lot about LA.

264
00:10:09.158 --> 00:10:11.390
- Seriously. - I like many things on his trip.

265
00:10:11.394 --> 00:10:13.055
I'm serious.

266
00:10:13.496 --> 00:10:15.560
By the way, we can't rest...

267
00:10:15.565 --> 00:10:16.790
during Jong Kook's tour.

268
00:10:16.799 --> 00:10:19.960
(By the way, we can't rest during Jong Kook's tour.)

269
00:10:19.969 --> 00:10:22.030
- I've been there with him before. - Okay.

270
00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:23.840
There were so many things we wanted to talk about.

271
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.170
I was so happy,

272
00:10:25.174 --> 00:10:26.940
but you come back about 7kg lighter.

273
00:10:26.943 --> 00:10:30.410
(Beware of the side effect.)

274
00:10:30.413 --> 00:10:32.480
- It's effective in losing weight. - Exactly.

275
00:10:32.482 --> 00:10:34.380
That's exactly my point.

276
00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:37.050
- Ji Hyo, it's your turn. - I like many things from his trip.

277
00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:39.620
This is my first time going to LA,

278
00:10:39.622 --> 00:10:42.050
so I came up with a list of things to do.

279
00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:44.525
Actually,

280
00:10:44.661 --> 00:10:48.825
I'm not a fan of going to tourist attractions.

281
00:10:49.032 --> 00:10:51.860
- I like lounging around. - Gosh.

282
00:10:51.868 --> 00:10:54.200
- You like zoning out. - Yes, I zone out.

283
00:10:54.203 --> 00:10:56.470
- That's more like my style. - Gosh.

284
00:10:56.472 --> 00:10:58.500
I hate following a strict schedule.

285
00:10:58.508 --> 00:10:59.800
- Same here. - Right.

286
00:10:59.809 --> 00:11:02.540
I don't want to go to a lot of places.

287
00:11:02.545 --> 00:11:03.810
- And... - That's right.

288
00:11:03.813 --> 00:11:06.540
- I like that about her trip. - That's great. That's how I roll.

289
00:11:06.549 --> 00:11:08.110
If we have to do whatever has been scheduled,

290
00:11:08.117 --> 00:11:09.580
- Right. - I would get stressed out...

291
00:11:09.585 --> 00:11:11.350
when I have to think about where we'll have to go next.

292
00:11:11.354 --> 00:11:13.150
- You're right. - That's why...

293
00:11:13.156 --> 00:11:15.950
we can have free time until 5pm to 6pm.

294
00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.820
(Dropping a bombshell)

295
00:11:18.828 --> 00:11:20.460
- Until 5pm to 6pm? - Wait.

296
00:11:20.463 --> 00:11:22.390
If so, isn't it better off to stay in Korea?

297
00:11:22.398 --> 00:11:24.100
Should we rest when we have gone all the way to LA?

298
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.630
If so, we can go separately. Why would we go there together?

299
00:11:25.635 --> 00:11:28.270
Why would we go to LA and rest until 5pm?

300
00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:30.400
The sun would set around 5pm or 6pm.

301
00:11:30.406 --> 00:11:31.500
(Yes, you guys are doing great.)

302
00:11:31.507 --> 00:11:32.940
Why would we go to LA then?

303
00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:34.910
It's because you want to sleep at home.

304
00:11:34.911 --> 00:11:37.780
In a way, this trip might be better. We might have more freedom.

305
00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:38.980
And...

306
00:11:38.981 --> 00:11:41.710
as you all know, Jong Kook doesn't drink.

307
00:11:41.718 --> 00:11:43.450
Yes, I don't drink alcohol.

308
00:11:43.453 --> 00:11:45.280
We can go there and have drinks together with meals.

309
00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:46.680
Will we play truth or dare?

310
00:11:46.689 --> 00:11:48.720
- We'll play that too! - Yes!

311
00:11:48.725 --> 00:11:50.250
(Ji Hyo's trump card is having drinks together.)

312
00:11:50.259 --> 00:11:52.020
(Ji Hyo finishes it off with playing truth or dare.)

313
00:11:52.028 --> 00:11:54.860
(The atmosphere totally changes after the announcement of the game.)

314
00:11:54.864 --> 00:11:56.060
- I like this great. - Ji Hyo...

315
00:11:56.065 --> 00:11:57.260
Are there any deals you'll offer us?

316
00:11:57.266 --> 00:11:59.360
Like you'll tell us a secret or something?

317
00:11:59.368 --> 00:12:01.430
Will you tell us the part you skipped...

318
00:12:01.437 --> 00:12:03.030
when you told us about your Christmas?

319
00:12:03.039 --> 00:12:04.370
That day with the balloons?

320
00:12:04.373 --> 00:12:06.070
- Will you tell us that story? - She should.

321
00:12:06.075 --> 00:12:07.340
That day with the balloons?

322
00:12:07.343 --> 00:12:11.340
(Let us elaborate on the part that Ji Hyo skipped.)

323
00:12:11.347 --> 00:12:17.080
(Her ex-boyfriend filled the room with balloons for Christmas.)

324
00:12:17.086 --> 00:12:20.420
(They had a glass of wine while feeling the romance of the event.)

325
00:12:20.423 --> 00:12:23.920
(Everyone was utterly focused.)

326
00:12:23.926 --> 00:12:27.560
(She skipped the middle part and said it was morning then.)

327
00:12:27.563 --> 00:12:31.900
(This Skipping Incident has enraged everyone.)

328
00:12:31.901 --> 00:12:33.800
- Will you tell us the story? - Will you tell us?

329
00:12:33.803 --> 00:12:35.370
- You'll tell us what you skipped? - Will you?

330
00:12:35.371 --> 00:12:36.470
I will share it!

331
00:12:36.472 --> 00:12:39.340
(The story of Ji Hyo's night that piqued everyone's curiosity...)

332
00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:41.070
- I'll tell you! - Yes!

333
00:12:41.077 --> 00:12:42.140
I have to choose hers.

334
00:12:42.145 --> 00:12:43.940
I've decided.

335
00:12:43.946 --> 00:12:45.810
I have to listen to that story.

336
00:12:45.815 --> 00:12:48.310
I couldn't sleep for a week.

337
00:12:48.317 --> 00:12:50.720
- I even made up stories. You know? - I...

338
00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:51.820
- I made up stories. - I will...

339
00:12:51.821 --> 00:12:54.390
What stands out the most from Ji Hyo's tour is...

340
00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:55.650
freedom.

341
00:12:55.658 --> 00:12:57.560
- We get to do what we want. - We can do what we want.

342
00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.260
- And we don't have to plan a trip. - I can do my own thing, right?

343
00:13:00.263 --> 00:13:02.660
- In a way, we get to rest up. - You only live once.

344
00:13:02.665 --> 00:13:05.030
- We'll divide into teams now. - Okay.

345
00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:06.900
Gosh, this is hard to decide.

346
00:13:06.903 --> 00:13:08.800
(The briefing is over, and they'll choose their teams.)

347
00:13:08.805 --> 00:13:10.900
- Why don't you go 1st, Se Chan? - Should I go 1st?

348
00:13:10.907 --> 00:13:11.940
(Se Chan will choose his team first.)

349
00:13:11.941 --> 00:13:14.140
To tell you the truth,

350
00:13:14.143 --> 00:13:16.370
one of their traveling styles...

351
00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:18.845
matches my style completely.

352
00:13:19.148 --> 00:13:20.810
It totally matches my style of traveling.

353
00:13:20.817 --> 00:13:24.350
(Whose traveling style matches Se Chan's completely?)

354
00:13:24.353 --> 00:13:27.120
I will go with this team.

355
00:13:27.123 --> 00:13:28.755
Okay!

356
00:13:29.025 --> 00:13:30.620
- Okay! - Let me explain.

357
00:13:30.626 --> 00:13:34.030
I want to tell all of my colleagues about my trip.

358
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.325
- That's right. - I want to share my memories.

359
00:13:36.766 --> 00:13:38.260
- So Min, it's your turn. - Me?

360
00:13:38.267 --> 00:13:40.035
So Min, go ahead.

361
00:13:40.369 --> 00:13:42.330
I really can't decide. It's really hard.

362
00:13:42.338 --> 00:13:44.170
So Min might not choose my team,

363
00:13:44.173 --> 00:13:45.700
but she'll regret a lot...

364
00:13:45.708 --> 00:13:48.745
because I know a lot of handsome guys in LA.

365
00:13:48.811 --> 00:13:50.310
- They are so handsome. - Actually,

366
00:13:50.313 --> 00:13:52.810
when I travel, I go on my own.

367
00:13:52.815 --> 00:13:55.110
I don't need to see a lot of stuff. That's my style.

368
00:13:55.117 --> 00:13:58.355
- Just go to Jong Kook now. - Go. Go.

369
00:13:58.688 --> 00:14:00.450
(You'll pick him. Don't stall time.)

370
00:14:00.456 --> 00:14:02.020
- Just go. - Fine.

371
00:14:02.024 --> 00:14:03.320
- Okay. - Great.

372
00:14:03.326 --> 00:14:04.820
(So Min chooses Team Champion.)

373
00:14:04.827 --> 00:14:06.820
- Great. - My goodness.

374
00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:09.260
- Ji Hyo looks really sad. - No.

375
00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:11.260
- You look sad as they chose him. - No, no.

376
00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:15.430
I have been neglecting that girl a lot lately.

377
00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:17.000
(Does he mean me?)

378
00:14:17.006 --> 00:14:18.000
"That girl"?

379
00:14:18.007 --> 00:14:19.700
I must listen to her story.

380
00:14:19.709 --> 00:14:21.340
(The part of her Christmas story she skipped)

381
00:14:21.344 --> 00:14:24.140
(Haha chooses Team Ace.)

382
00:14:24.146 --> 00:14:26.115
I bet it's new.

383
00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:27.750
Kwang Soo. Well, he will...

384
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.250
Kwang Soo, why don't you choose now?

385
00:14:30.253 --> 00:14:32.750
- Okay. - Kwang Soo has been to LA with me.

386
00:14:32.755 --> 00:14:35.490
- That might happen. - I'll do everything I did then.

387
00:14:35.491 --> 00:14:38.160
(As he mentions he'll do everything he did from their last trip...)

388
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.460
- Remember our beautiful memories? - Seriously?

389
00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:42.625
(He reminds Kwang Soo of their memories.)

390
00:14:42.999 --> 00:14:45.230
(Do you remember our beautiful memories together?)

391
00:14:45.234 --> 00:14:48.470
(Our friendship shone like the sun in LA.)

392
00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:50.835
Remember our beautiful memories?

393
00:14:51.607 --> 00:14:53.470
(He's reminded of his bromance memories.)

394
00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:54.640
I choose Jong Kook!

395
00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:57.805
(He has decided.)

396
00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:00.540
(Kwang Soo chooses Team Champion.)

397
00:15:00.549 --> 00:15:02.310
- Come. Come to me. - Gosh.

398
00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:03.610
This is no joke.

399
00:15:03.619 --> 00:15:05.280
I'll go with Ji Hyo.

400
00:15:05.288 --> 00:15:07.055
- Okay. - Okay!

401
00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:09.950
- Ji Hyo. - He didn't come for the freedom.

402
00:15:09.959 --> 00:15:11.890
To be honest, I'm really curious about that skipped part.

403
00:15:11.894 --> 00:15:13.120
(He only has one reason.)

404
00:15:13.129 --> 00:15:14.830
I will hear the rest of the story from Ji Hyo.

405
00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.430
- I'll make sure I hear it. - I will too.

406
00:15:16.432 --> 00:15:18.060
- We'll talk all night long. - Okay.

407
00:15:18.067 --> 00:15:19.230
- Come join us, Seok Jin. - Okay.

408
00:15:19.235 --> 00:15:21.370
- I'll have better chances there. - Okay.

409
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:23.170
I'll go with that team.

410
00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:25.240
I can see disappointment on your face.

411
00:15:25.241 --> 00:15:26.440
- I'm happy. - Okay.

412
00:15:26.442 --> 00:15:27.970
(Team Ace and Team Champion)

413
00:15:27.977 --> 00:15:31.745
(The teams have been formed.)

414
00:15:32.415 --> 00:15:34.445
(Ace)

415
00:15:35.084 --> 00:15:36.410
(She's always chosen and always survives.)

416
00:15:36.419 --> 00:15:40.080
(She's the queen of luck at random draws.)

417
00:15:40.089 --> 00:15:42.485
(The Lucky Ace, Song Ji Hyo)

418
00:15:42.992 --> 00:15:44.925
(Champion)

419
00:15:45.194 --> 00:15:47.330
(He dominates the games with speed and power.)

420
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.930
(He's the undefeated champion, Kim Jong Kook.)

421
00:15:49.932 --> 00:15:53.895
(The best members of the show will have their official match.)

422
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.765
(Ace versus the Champion, who will be the winner?)

423
00:15:57.707 --> 00:16:00.470
Today, it's the Ace versus the Champion.

424
00:16:00.476 --> 00:16:02.370
- It's a team match. - Okay.

425
00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:04.810
The match will consist of three rounds in total.

426
00:16:04.814 --> 00:16:06.710
Isn't this the first time they're competing against each other?

427
00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:07.880
- Yes, it's the first time. - Goodness.

428
00:16:07.883 --> 00:16:10.980
Depending on the results of each round,

429
00:16:10.987 --> 00:16:13.280
you will be given the slots on the roulette accordingly.

430
00:16:13.289 --> 00:16:14.690
- The slots on the roulette? - We'll spin the roulette.

431
00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:17.150
- We'll spin that again? - My gosh, the roulette.

432
00:16:17.159 --> 00:16:19.860
After the third round, you'll spin the roulette.

433
00:16:19.862 --> 00:16:23.260
The chosen member will be the final winner.

434
00:16:23.265 --> 00:16:25.935
This is your first round.

435
00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:29.700
(Ace versus the Champion, Round 1)

436
00:16:29.705 --> 00:16:31.900
It's a quiz called the Fate of Go or Stop.

437
00:16:31.907 --> 00:16:34.070
- Okay! - It's a quiz?

438
00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:35.270
Is the quiz related to the card game?

439
00:16:35.277 --> 00:16:38.340
You'll hear the quiz. If you answer the quiz correctly,

440
00:16:38.347 --> 00:16:42.010
you will choose 1 of the 10 sets...

441
00:16:42.018 --> 00:16:43.980
- on the table. - Okay.

442
00:16:43.986 --> 00:16:48.285
In each set, there are points, varying from 1 to 5.

443
00:16:48.357 --> 00:16:50.655
And there are two cups that are duds.

444
00:16:50.793 --> 00:16:52.960
- Duds? My gosh, duds. - Okay.

445
00:16:52.962 --> 00:16:55.690
When you choose the cups and gain points,

446
00:16:55.698 --> 00:16:59.160
you will earn the chosen points and have a chance to choose again.

447
00:16:59.168 --> 00:17:01.900
If you pick a dud cup, your points will go back to zero.

448
00:17:01.904 --> 00:17:04.640
- Your points will go back to 0. - It'll go back to 0?

449
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.340
- We'll lose points we gathered? - Yes.

450
00:17:06.342 --> 00:17:08.840
(Choosing to stop before the dud is the key.)

451
00:17:08.844 --> 00:17:12.280
- There's Jae Seok, the Zero Guy. - There are so many unlucky ones.

452
00:17:12.281 --> 00:17:13.510
- There's Jae Seok. - You'll lose.

453
00:17:13.516 --> 00:17:15.010
- He was Level Zero. - Yu Zero.

454
00:17:15.017 --> 00:17:16.480
- We'll win no matter what. - My gosh.

455
00:17:16.485 --> 00:17:18.280
(He went back to Level 0 from Level 1.)

456
00:17:18.287 --> 00:17:21.220
After you open up cup and want to continue on,

457
00:17:21.223 --> 00:17:22.350
you can shout, "go".

458
00:17:22.358 --> 00:17:23.650
(The points will accumulate.)

459
00:17:23.659 --> 00:17:24.890
Say that you have earned points,

460
00:17:24.894 --> 00:17:26.190
- The points will accumulate. - but if it's a dud, you get zero.

461
00:17:26.195 --> 00:17:27.590
- Okay. I got it. - I should keep going.

462
00:17:27.596 --> 00:17:29.090
- These two are great at that. - Stopping at the right time is god.

463
00:17:29.098 --> 00:17:30.860
- We should keep going. - Okay, great.

464
00:17:30.866 --> 00:17:32.860
Let us tell you how this game came about.

465
00:17:32.868 --> 00:17:35.065
Jong Kook is good at solving quizzes.

466
00:17:35.237 --> 00:17:37.940
- Ji Hyo is great at random draws. - Random draws.

467
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.600
Hold on.

468
00:17:39.608 --> 00:17:42.270
Hold on. Are you implying that Ji Hyo is bad at solving quizzes?

469
00:17:42.278 --> 00:17:43.840
Then is she good at it?

470
00:17:43.846 --> 00:17:45.180
- We didn't say that. - Ji Hyo?

471
00:17:45.181 --> 00:17:46.580
Then is she good at it?

472
00:17:46.582 --> 00:17:48.380
(Come on, how dare you?)

473
00:17:48.384 --> 00:17:49.980
- When did we say that? - Did we say that?

474
00:17:49.985 --> 00:17:51.220
- Listen. - You went over that.

475
00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.680
And you hurt her twice.

476
00:17:52.688 --> 00:17:53.920
- Ji Hyo chooses not to do it. - This kind of questioning...

477
00:17:53.923 --> 00:17:54.990
- would offend Ji Hyo. - Sit down.

478
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:56.990
- You hurt me twice. - Ji Hyo.

479
00:17:56.992 --> 00:17:58.890
- You just choose not to answer it. - Sure.

480
00:17:58.894 --> 00:18:01.130
Ji Hyo answered the quizzes a few times,

481
00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.925
but it didn't air because her answers were too shocking.

482
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.235
- She goes beyond quizzes. - Hey, stop it!

483
00:18:07.803 --> 00:18:10.965
The team with more points will get five slots on the roulette.

484
00:18:11.006 --> 00:18:13.505
- The losing team will get one slot. - Okay.

485
00:18:13.776 --> 00:18:15.570
Gosh, that's a huge difference.

486
00:18:15.578 --> 00:18:16.940
My goodness, this is serious.

487
00:18:16.946 --> 00:18:19.240
- Yes, there has to be a difference. - In my opinion,

488
00:18:19.248 --> 00:18:21.150
- this is why Ji Hyo's team... - Okay.

489
00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:22.750
is called Team Ace.

490
00:18:22.751 --> 00:18:23.850
- Even if they take 5, - That 1 slot...

491
00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:25.750
- might get chosen. - we can win with one slot.

492
00:18:25.754 --> 00:18:28.655
- That's the fun of having one slot. - We'll show you that.

493
00:18:29.024 --> 00:18:31.360
Here's why our team is great. Even though she's the team leader,

494
00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.995
she's quiet.

495
00:18:33.562 --> 00:18:35.460
- She doesn't make requests. - That's right.

496
00:18:35.464 --> 00:18:37.630
- Just like her traveling style. - She doesn't bother us.

497
00:18:37.633 --> 00:18:38.660
Our trip will be like that too.

498
00:18:38.667 --> 00:18:40.260
- That's our traveling style too. - She won't bother us.

499
00:18:40.269 --> 00:18:42.200
- We're the definition of freedom. - Our team centers around freedom.

500
00:18:42.204 --> 00:18:43.300
- Freedom. - Right.

501
00:18:43.305 --> 00:18:45.235
They're getting way ahead of themselves.

502
00:18:45.307 --> 00:18:46.500
As for your team,

503
00:18:46.509 --> 00:18:49.740
It seems like your team revolves around Jong Kook.

504
00:18:49.745 --> 00:18:50.740
Are you not happy right now?

505
00:18:50.746 --> 00:18:52.210
- No, I am. - You can tell us.

506
00:18:52.214 --> 00:18:53.910
- I'm doing great. - Be honest.

507
00:18:53.916 --> 00:18:56.110
We stay quiet if he does.

508
00:18:56.118 --> 00:18:58.250
I'm doing fine, don't worry.

509
00:18:58.254 --> 00:18:59.950
- Ji Hyo, let me take this off. - Sure.

510
00:18:59.955 --> 00:19:01.720
- Do as you please. - I'm going to pick my nose.

511
00:19:01.724 --> 00:19:02.890
Ji Hyo, I'm going to cross my legs.

512
00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:05.190
- I don't care. - Ji Hyo.

513
00:19:05.194 --> 00:19:07.095
I'll be natural.

514
00:19:07.163 --> 00:19:08.360
Just be casual.

515
00:19:08.364 --> 00:19:09.590
Okay, let's go!

516
00:19:09.598 --> 00:19:13.900
If you get it wrong, the other team will hit you with a toy hammer.

517
00:19:13.903 --> 00:19:15.570
- Okay. - Okay.

518
00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:17.200
- Bring it on! - That's great.

519
00:19:17.206 --> 00:19:18.940
- That's great. - Bring it on.

520
00:19:18.941 --> 00:19:20.775
Show them your strength.

521
00:19:20.843 --> 00:19:21.970
(They revolt.)

522
00:19:21.977 --> 00:19:24.915
Hey, I'm only going to hit one person.

523
00:19:25.047 --> 00:19:26.080
Just one.

524
00:19:26.081 --> 00:19:27.850
(He gets hit.)

525
00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:29.710
- Darn it. - Sorry.

526
00:19:29.718 --> 00:19:32.680
(Jae Seok also only hits one person.)

527
00:19:32.688 --> 00:19:34.290
I was just swinging it.

528
00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:37.020
- Hey. Ji Hyo, look at him. - I was just swinging.

529
00:19:37.026 --> 00:19:38.390
- All right. - Ji Hyo...

530
00:19:38.394 --> 00:19:40.890
- doesn't comment on anything. - Whatever.

531
00:19:40.896 --> 00:19:42.565
Just do what you need to do.

532
00:19:43.365 --> 00:19:45.260
- You're my role model. - That's great.

533
00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:47.300
He's a 54-year-old who gets hit on the head.

534
00:19:47.303 --> 00:19:49.430
(Nevertheless, he keeps smiling.)

535
00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:52.470
- You're so cool. - My eyes should've popped out.

536
00:19:52.474 --> 00:19:53.800
They should have.

537
00:19:53.809 --> 00:19:55.170
You're right.

538
00:19:55.177 --> 00:19:57.305
First question.

539
00:19:57.379 --> 00:20:00.840
Which of these words didn't originate from playing yut?

540
00:20:00.849 --> 00:20:02.810
- Yut? - All right.

541
00:20:02.818 --> 00:20:04.820
One, "cajole".

542
00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:05.850
- What? - What is that?

543
00:20:05.854 --> 00:20:08.285
Two, "only".

544
00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:11.360
Three, "competent".

545
00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.825
Four, "all the same".

546
00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:16.465
Let me answer. One.

547
00:20:16.498 --> 00:20:18.935
- Let me answer. 1. - I think it's 3.

548
00:20:19.034 --> 00:20:20.100
I thought so too.

549
00:20:20.102 --> 00:20:21.930
- I think it is. - I think so.

550
00:20:21.937 --> 00:20:23.330
"Cajole".

551
00:20:23.339 --> 00:20:24.940
You don't use that word when you play yut.

552
00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.600
I don't think...

553
00:20:26.609 --> 00:20:28.010
- they use that word. - Right.

554
00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:30.975
- Okay! - Okay!

555
00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.010
(They get the first question...)

556
00:20:33.015 --> 00:20:35.915
(thanks to Kwang Soo.)

557
00:20:36.252 --> 00:20:37.820
(Did you see that?)

558
00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:38.920
(You will go down today.)

559
00:20:38.921 --> 00:20:41.350
Hey, Kwang Soo.

560
00:20:41.357 --> 00:20:44.760
(You're all dead.)

561
00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.220
Darn it.

562
00:20:46.228 --> 00:20:47.520
(Furious)

563
00:20:47.529 --> 00:20:48.930
You're amazing. Great.

564
00:20:48.931 --> 00:20:51.430
(Team Ace, what are you doing?)

565
00:20:51.433 --> 00:20:53.000
(I almost fell asleep.)

566
00:20:53.002 --> 00:20:55.005
How did you know?

567
00:20:55.738 --> 00:20:57.230
(You just wait and see.)

568
00:20:57.239 --> 00:20:59.270
- I'm so furious. - Me too.

569
00:20:59.275 --> 00:21:01.010
- Good job. - I thought it was "only".

570
00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:03.170
The question was easy.

571
00:21:03.178 --> 00:21:05.940
- Next is Team Champion. - Let's go.

572
00:21:05.948 --> 00:21:08.380
- Please pick one and open it. - Dud, dud, dud

573
00:21:08.384 --> 00:21:10.680
- Dud, dud, dud - Dud, dud, dud

574
00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:12.020
Let it be a dud.

575
00:21:12.021 --> 00:21:13.550
- 5 or 6? - I recommend Kwang Soo.

576
00:21:13.555 --> 00:21:15.555
- What do you think? - I think it's four.

577
00:21:15.591 --> 00:21:17.120
- Well... - Don't pick four.

578
00:21:17.126 --> 00:21:18.220
- Right. - I'm sure.

579
00:21:18.227 --> 00:21:21.330
Which one do you pick?

580
00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:22.560
Will you be helping us?

581
00:21:22.564 --> 00:21:24.500
- The opposing team will help. - He's the helper?

582
00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.060
You shouldn't touch them.

583
00:21:26.068 --> 00:21:27.770
- Don't pick 4 or 6. - Don't.

584
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:29.070
He touched them.

585
00:21:29.071 --> 00:21:30.830
(They're positive those 2 will be duds.)

586
00:21:30.839 --> 00:21:32.700
- Right. - Because I touched them?

587
00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:33.870
How dare you?

588
00:21:33.876 --> 00:21:35.240
- Right. - Take those out.

589
00:21:35.244 --> 00:21:37.010
I'm flabbergasted.

590
00:21:37.012 --> 00:21:38.640
Do you think the first one will be a dud?

591
00:21:38.647 --> 00:21:40.240
- It could be. - One?

592
00:21:40.249 --> 00:21:41.350
- 7 or 8? - Let's go with 8.

593
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.545
- 8? All right. - Yes.

594
00:21:43.552 --> 00:21:45.520
(Jong Kook doesn't care about their opinions.)

595
00:21:45.521 --> 00:21:47.650
Wait, hold on.

596
00:21:47.656 --> 00:21:49.090
Didn't you want the first one?

597
00:21:49.091 --> 00:21:50.390
Yes, but I changed.

598
00:21:50.392 --> 00:21:52.590
He wanted to change.

599
00:21:52.594 --> 00:21:54.790
- His opinion matters. - Wait.

600
00:21:54.797 --> 00:21:56.190
- Let's pick eight. - Just...

601
00:21:56.198 --> 00:21:58.130
Just do as Jong Kook says.

602
00:21:58.133 --> 00:21:59.630
But we should still share our opinions.

603
00:21:59.635 --> 00:22:01.570
We all had different preferences, but we followed Jong Kook.

604
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:02.700
- It's eight. - It is.

605
00:22:02.705 --> 00:22:03.870
(Jong Kook has the power over them.)

606
00:22:03.872 --> 00:22:05.300
- Then 8, it is. - 8, please.

607
00:22:05.307 --> 00:22:06.400
All right.

608
00:22:06.408 --> 00:22:08.140
(This was Jong Kook's choice.)

609
00:22:08.143 --> 00:22:13.615
(Will he be able to avoid the dud?)

610
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:15.310
- 5! - 5!

611
00:22:15.317 --> 00:22:18.555
(It's 5 points.)

612
00:22:19.688 --> 00:22:21.220
(They receive 5 points from the start.)

613
00:22:21.223 --> 00:22:22.690
- Jong Kook! - Five points!

614
00:22:22.691 --> 00:22:24.460
(He's surely amazing.)

615
00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.120
- Should we stop here? - You're amazing.

616
00:22:26.128 --> 00:22:27.560
- That'll be boring. - You should continue.

617
00:22:27.563 --> 00:22:29.460
- Be a man. - Come on.

618
00:22:29.465 --> 00:22:31.395
Shall we just stop here?

619
00:22:31.567 --> 00:22:33.500
If it were up to me, I'd just stop here.

620
00:22:33.502 --> 00:22:34.870
You should go on.

621
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:36.770
- Let's do four. - What?

622
00:22:36.772 --> 00:22:39.170
- Let's try it. - I don't think that's right.

623
00:22:39.174 --> 00:22:40.800
Just once more. Let's pick the first one.

624
00:22:40.809 --> 00:22:43.210
- You should continue. - First one.

625
00:22:43.212 --> 00:22:44.880
- First one. - Go on.

626
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.440
- You shouldn't stop here. - Go on.

627
00:22:46.448 --> 00:22:47.440
I pick eight.

628
00:22:47.449 --> 00:22:48.510
- Open it. - Go!

629
00:22:48.517 --> 00:22:50.380
(He continues.)

630
00:22:50.386 --> 00:22:52.050
- All right. - Let's go!

631
00:22:52.054 --> 00:22:53.720
- Please. - All right.

632
00:22:53.722 --> 00:22:55.850
- Open it. - I think this one's not right.

633
00:22:55.858 --> 00:22:57.720
He already picked this one.

634
00:22:57.726 --> 00:23:00.120
Dud, dud, dud.ud

635
00:23:00.129 --> 00:23:03.495
(Is it a dud, or will they get points?)

636
00:23:03.832 --> 00:23:07.930
(Will he make the right choice once again?)

637
00:23:07.936 --> 00:23:10.365
- Dud! - Dud!

638
00:23:11.173 --> 00:23:12.200
- Dud! - Dud!

639
00:23:12.207 --> 00:23:16.640
(It's a dud, and their previous 5 points don't count.)

640
00:23:16.645 --> 00:23:19.180
- It's a dud - It's a dud

641
00:23:19.181 --> 00:23:20.710
I knew it.

642
00:23:20.716 --> 00:23:23.480
- I knew it. - How could it be a dud?

643
00:23:23.485 --> 00:23:24.550
I wanted to pick seven.

644
00:23:24.553 --> 00:23:26.820
- I wanted to pick one. - We should know when to stop.

645
00:23:26.822 --> 00:23:27.950
We learned a lesson.

646
00:23:27.956 --> 00:23:29.250
- Okay. - Okay.

647
00:23:29.258 --> 00:23:30.520
(Jong Kook shares his lesson,)

648
00:23:30.526 --> 00:23:31.660
(and Se Chan listens to him.)

649
00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.990
We learned a lesson.

650
00:23:32.995 --> 00:23:34.890
- We did. - You're so positive.

651
00:23:34.897 --> 00:23:36.890
- You sound so generous. - I am.

652
00:23:36.899 --> 00:23:38.200
Stop pretending.

653
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.630
I learned a lesson.

654
00:23:39.635 --> 00:23:41.170
Let's win this time.

655
00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.130
Here's the second question.

656
00:23:43.138 --> 00:23:47.040
Which of these mountains doesn't exist in Korea?

657
00:23:47.042 --> 00:23:49.210
- All right. - I'm confident.

658
00:23:49.211 --> 00:23:52.245
One, "Mount Woo".

659
00:23:52.381 --> 00:23:53.880
- One, "Mount Woo". - That's a mountain?

660
00:23:53.882 --> 00:23:55.350
- Mount Woo? - What?

661
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:57.010
- Two... - Is this nonsensical?

662
00:23:57.019 --> 00:23:58.020
(He asks about the question.)

663
00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.050
No, no.

664
00:23:59.054 --> 00:24:01.320
- He said, "Mount Woo". - It must be a mountain.

665
00:24:01.323 --> 00:24:03.085
- No? - Okay.

666
00:24:03.525 --> 00:24:06.060
- I'm sorry. - I think it's number one.

667
00:24:06.061 --> 00:24:07.990
How does "Mount Woo" make sense?

668
00:24:07.996 --> 00:24:09.990
Two, "Mount Ttan".

669
00:24:09.998 --> 00:24:11.030
- What? - "Mount Ttan"?

670
00:24:11.033 --> 00:24:12.330
- "Mount Ttan"? - Come on.

671
00:24:12.334 --> 00:24:14.735
- This is nonsensical, right? - How can we pick one?

672
00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:17.200
- I don't get this. - They want us to guess.

673
00:24:17.206 --> 00:24:18.640
"Mount Meon".

674
00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.340
Let me answer.

675
00:24:20.342 --> 00:24:21.810
(Seok Jin attempts to answer.)

676
00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:23.210
Three, "Mount Meon".

677
00:24:23.212 --> 00:24:25.675
- 1 more time, please? - 3, "Mount Meon".

678
00:24:26.014 --> 00:24:27.610
"Mount Meon".

679
00:24:27.616 --> 00:24:30.050
(They get it right.)

680
00:24:30.052 --> 00:24:31.915
You're amazing.

681
00:24:31.954 --> 00:24:33.280
- He's amazing. - "Mount Meon"!

682
00:24:33.288 --> 00:24:34.985
He's amazing.

683
00:24:35.357 --> 00:24:36.690
(Hitting)

684
00:24:36.692 --> 00:24:38.355
Why are you hitting us?

685
00:24:38.494 --> 00:24:40.660
(He surprises them.)

686
00:24:40.662 --> 00:24:41.790
- Why did you hit me? - Why?

687
00:24:41.797 --> 00:24:43.260
- Why did he? - What?

688
00:24:43.265 --> 00:24:44.700
- What? - He need to get hit.

689
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.700
- You should get hit too. - Why?

690
00:24:46.702 --> 00:24:48.870
- Why did you hit us? - No.

691
00:24:48.871 --> 00:24:50.230
- Is he insane? - Come on.

692
00:24:50.239 --> 00:24:51.800
- I was just happy. - Why?

693
00:24:51.807 --> 00:24:53.740
- He needs to be hit. - Why did you hit them?

694
00:24:53.742 --> 00:24:55.340
- What's going on? - Why did you?

695
00:24:55.344 --> 00:24:56.540
- I'm not sure. - Hit him.

696
00:24:56.545 --> 00:24:57.810
- Just hit him. - I blocked it.

697
00:24:57.813 --> 00:24:59.710
- Hey, you should help me. - Let's take turns.

698
00:24:59.715 --> 00:25:00.840
- I blocked it. - Why did you hit us?

699
00:25:00.849 --> 00:25:02.580
- I was just happy. - Why did you do that?

700
00:25:02.584 --> 00:25:04.880
- I didn't mean to. - Be still.

701
00:25:04.887 --> 00:25:07.180
(He takes off Seok Jin's hat and glasses.)

702
00:25:07.189 --> 00:25:08.590
- Be still. - What?

703
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:09.690
Be still.

704
00:25:09.691 --> 00:25:11.190
- Why? - I'm so confused.

705
00:25:11.193 --> 00:25:12.290
- Why did you do it? - Why?

706
00:25:12.294 --> 00:25:14.420
(Hitting)

707
00:25:14.429 --> 00:25:15.690
- Why? - Why?

708
00:25:15.697 --> 00:25:17.860
(He regrets his actions.)

709
00:25:17.866 --> 00:25:20.660
(It hurts him a lot.)

710
00:25:20.669 --> 00:25:22.000
Goodness.

711
00:25:22.004 --> 00:25:23.800
- It's give and take. - Hey.

712
00:25:23.805 --> 00:25:25.440
- You don't usually hit him. - I was...

713
00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.940
- I was just happy. - You don't usually do that.

714
00:25:26.942 --> 00:25:28.110
- I was happy. - You were?

715
00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:29.410
I thought you're supposed to hit when you're happy.

716
00:25:29.411 --> 00:25:30.670
- Okay. - I see.

717
00:25:30.679 --> 00:25:31.880
Hey, hit me.

718
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.940
- Hit me. - Okay.

719
00:25:33.949 --> 00:25:34.950
One more left.

720
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:36.380
(It's Kwang Soo's turn.)

721
00:25:36.385 --> 00:25:38.450
(He hits him with the handle.)

722
00:25:38.453 --> 00:25:40.115
Oh, my.

723
00:25:40.322 --> 00:25:41.985
Why?

724
00:25:42.324 --> 00:25:44.720
(A dull sound was heard.)

725
00:25:44.726 --> 00:25:46.160
Goodness.

726
00:25:46.161 --> 00:25:48.690
I was so happy that I wanted to hit you with the handle.

727
00:25:48.697 --> 00:25:51.090
- Okay. - I can't believe you.

728
00:25:51.099 --> 00:25:52.130
Okay.

729
00:25:52.134 --> 00:25:54.160
- Why do I feel defeated? - Gosh.

730
00:25:54.169 --> 00:25:55.370
(They were the ones who got the question right.)

731
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:56.770
My goodness.

732
00:25:56.772 --> 00:25:59.000
- I'm confused. - I was so shocked.

733
00:25:59.007 --> 00:26:00.600
I was just so happy.

734
00:26:00.609 --> 00:26:02.810
All right. Pick a dud for us.

735
00:26:02.811 --> 00:26:04.140
- All right. - All right.

736
00:26:04.146 --> 00:26:05.710
I'm sure there will be a dud.

737
00:26:05.714 --> 00:26:06.810
I'll go since I got it right.

738
00:26:06.815 --> 00:26:08.850
Go with eight.

739
00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:10.180
- Pick eight. - Stay still.

740
00:26:10.185 --> 00:26:11.620
- There can't be consecutive duds. - Stay still.

741
00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:13.020
- Right. - Let Ji Hyo pick.

742
00:26:13.021 --> 00:26:15.420
Let her pick. Go.

743
00:26:15.424 --> 00:26:16.950
Are you the team leader?

744
00:26:16.959 --> 00:26:20.060
(Who are you to tell us what to do?)

745
00:26:20.062 --> 00:26:22.530
- You're not one either. - I know but...

746
00:26:22.531 --> 00:26:23.790
Ji Hyo should go.

747
00:26:23.799 --> 00:26:26.600
Do you think being nice to her will make her pick you?

748
00:26:26.602 --> 00:26:27.630
(I know your intentions.)

749
00:26:27.636 --> 00:26:28.730
You knew, didn't you?

750
00:26:28.737 --> 00:26:31.440
- He's so sly. - What is he?

751
00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.340
Ji Hyo, please pick.

752
00:26:33.342 --> 00:26:36.310
If it's another dud, that'll be baffling.

753
00:26:36.311 --> 00:26:37.540
Let's play it safe.

754
00:26:37.546 --> 00:26:39.140
- Let's be safe. - Then...

755
00:26:39.147 --> 00:26:40.240
- I pick eight. - Okay!

756
00:26:40.248 --> 00:26:41.510
- Okay. - It won't be a dud.

757
00:26:41.516 --> 00:26:43.815
(Ji Hyo picks 8.)

758
00:26:43.852 --> 00:26:45.280
- I pick eight. - Open it.

759
00:26:45.287 --> 00:26:46.880
(Previously, 8 was a dud.)

760
00:26:46.888 --> 00:26:53.395
(Will Ji Hyo's prediction be correct?)

761
00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:56.460
(3 points)

762
00:26:56.465 --> 00:26:58.160
- All right. - Great start.

763
00:26:58.166 --> 00:27:01.130
- Let's go again. - All right.

764
00:27:01.136 --> 00:27:03.070
I want to stop here.

765
00:27:03.071 --> 00:27:04.170
(She's careful.)

766
00:27:04.172 --> 00:27:05.500
Let's do it.

767
00:27:05.507 --> 00:27:07.300
- Let's try one more time. - Wait.

768
00:27:07.309 --> 00:27:08.610
Let's go with eight once more!

769
00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:09.910
- Wait. - Pick eight again!

770
00:27:09.911 --> 00:27:12.580
- Ask her. - Ji Hyo, just go with it.

771
00:27:12.581 --> 00:27:13.680
- Let's not go with eight. - Wait.

772
00:27:13.682 --> 00:27:15.650
- Ji Hyo. - Are you the leader?

773
00:27:15.651 --> 00:27:17.485
- Go. - Ji Hyo.

774
00:27:17.686 --> 00:27:18.720
- Go! - Go.

775
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.020
Let's go with eight.

776
00:27:20.022 --> 00:27:21.120
- Go! - Go.

777
00:27:21.123 --> 00:27:22.120
Let's go with eight.

778
00:27:22.124 --> 00:27:25.860
(Will they receive points once more?)

779
00:27:25.861 --> 00:27:30.560
(Will Jae Seok's choice make Ji Hyo smile?)

780
00:27:30.565 --> 00:27:33.230
(It's a dud.)

781
00:27:33.235 --> 00:27:34.730
- Okay! - Okay!

782
00:27:34.736 --> 00:27:37.900
(They forgot how unlucky Jae Seok is.)

783
00:27:37.906 --> 00:27:40.140
How could that happen?

784
00:27:40.142 --> 00:27:41.940
There were 2 duds for 1 number.

785
00:27:41.943 --> 00:27:43.840
That means the rest of the cups...

786
00:27:43.845 --> 00:27:45.240
- They're safe. - are safe.

787
00:27:45.247 --> 00:27:47.180
- It's safe. - Right.

788
00:27:47.182 --> 00:27:48.850
- Let's pick that number. - We have to win.

789
00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:50.350
- We have to. - We must.

790
00:27:50.352 --> 00:27:51.620
- All right then. - Let's go.

791
00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.220
- We must see to it. - All right.

792
00:27:53.221 --> 00:27:54.450
- Go. - There are two duds.

793
00:27:54.456 --> 00:27:55.620
Number eight is a jackpot.

794
00:27:55.624 --> 00:27:56.950
Darn you all.

795
00:27:56.958 --> 00:27:58.120
Let's go.

796
00:27:58.126 --> 00:28:00.020
- We must get this one right. - We have to.

797
00:28:00.028 --> 00:28:02.030
- All right. - Third question.

798
00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:07.765
What is the word that refers to bluffers and liars?

799
00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:10.130
Lee Kwang Soo.

800
00:28:10.138 --> 00:28:12.505
Which number is it?

801
00:28:12.708 --> 00:28:13.800
It's right?

802
00:28:13.809 --> 00:28:16.505
(He was just guessing.)

803
00:28:16.912 --> 00:28:18.880
- I'm in the choices? - Hold on.

804
00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.280
- I'm not a bluffer. - It's in there?

805
00:28:20.282 --> 00:28:21.310
It is in here.

806
00:28:21.316 --> 00:28:22.850
Really? Truly?

807
00:28:22.851 --> 00:28:24.610
- That's the answer. - That's great.

808
00:28:24.619 --> 00:28:26.120
- I'm in there? - Great.

809
00:28:26.121 --> 00:28:29.620
- One, "large-eyed herring". - That's wrong.

810
00:28:29.624 --> 00:28:31.690
Two, "Lee Kwang Soo".

811
00:28:31.693 --> 00:28:33.460
(He was really a part of it.)

812
00:28:33.462 --> 00:28:35.460
- Lee Kwang Soo? - He's really a part of it.

813
00:28:35.464 --> 00:28:37.360
I come after large-eyed herring?

814
00:28:37.365 --> 00:28:39.730
- He was in the choices. - He was.

815
00:28:39.735 --> 00:28:40.900
Yes.

816
00:28:40.902 --> 00:28:42.400
Three, "a street singer".

817
00:28:42.404 --> 00:28:43.470
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

818
00:28:43.472 --> 00:28:44.630
- No, no. - That's right.

819
00:28:44.639 --> 00:28:45.640
- Let me answer. - That's right.

820
00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.670
Three, "a street singer".

821
00:28:46.675 --> 00:28:48.440
(He is sure.)

822
00:28:48.443 --> 00:28:49.670
Isn't it right?

823
00:28:49.678 --> 00:28:52.810
(They change their answer.)

824
00:28:52.814 --> 00:28:54.610
- It's number four then. - I think it is.

825
00:28:54.616 --> 00:28:56.685
Use the toy hammer.

826
00:28:56.918 --> 00:28:59.280
Jong Kook, let's just hit Seok Jin.

827
00:28:59.287 --> 00:29:02.525
(Let's do the same thing he did.)

828
00:29:04.025 --> 00:29:06.520
- Seok Jin? - Hit the one who got it wrong.

829
00:29:06.528 --> 00:29:09.595
- If you don't care, I'll pick one. - What?

830
00:29:10.265 --> 00:29:11.260
Okay, they don't care.

831
00:29:11.266 --> 00:29:13.195
- Okay. - What?

832
00:29:14.636 --> 00:29:16.130
They don't care.

833
00:29:16.138 --> 00:29:18.270
(If they don't care, it'll be Seok Jin.)

834
00:29:18.273 --> 00:29:20.170
- Why me? - They don't care.

835
00:29:20.175 --> 00:29:22.240
- Hey. Stay still. - We pick you.

836
00:29:22.244 --> 00:29:23.710
- Wait a minute. - Why?

837
00:29:23.712 --> 00:29:25.440
- Aren't you afraid? - They said...

838
00:29:25.447 --> 00:29:27.880
- they don't care. - It doesn't matter.

839
00:29:27.883 --> 00:29:29.280
Hit him.

840
00:29:29.284 --> 00:29:33.350
I'll hit lighter than before.

841
00:29:33.355 --> 00:29:34.420
(Everyone pities him.)

842
00:29:34.422 --> 00:29:35.790
It's lighter, right?

843
00:29:35.791 --> 00:29:37.090
(They shouldn't get them wrong anymore.)

844
00:29:37.092 --> 00:29:38.360
(What is the word that refers to bluffers and liars?)

845
00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.420
- Four, "big talker". - Let me answer.

846
00:29:40.428 --> 00:29:42.590
(Kwang Soo was quick.)

847
00:29:42.597 --> 00:29:44.260
- Kwang Soo. - It's the last one.

848
00:29:44.266 --> 00:29:47.635
(Jong Kook thinks it's the last one.)

849
00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:52.700
(If they get it right, they'll receive 7 points.)

850
00:29:52.707 --> 00:29:53.940
One, "large-eyed herring".

851
00:29:53.942 --> 00:29:55.440
- What? Hey. - What?

852
00:29:55.443 --> 00:29:56.610
(All of a sudden?)

853
00:29:56.611 --> 00:30:00.010
- What? What are you doing? - Wait.

854
00:30:00.015 --> 00:30:01.080
What are you doing?

855
00:30:01.082 --> 00:30:02.110
- Let me answer. - Let me answer.

856
00:30:02.117 --> 00:30:04.680
- Let me answer. - Four, "big talker".

857
00:30:04.686 --> 00:30:06.120
- It's number four. - Okay!

858
00:30:06.121 --> 00:30:07.680
(The answer is "big talker".)

859
00:30:07.689 --> 00:30:09.350
We need to hit him.

860
00:30:09.357 --> 00:30:11.825
Hold on. One person from our team will...

861
00:30:12.027 --> 00:30:14.125
(He suddenly pops up and hits him.)

862
00:30:14.196 --> 00:30:15.890
(Fly like a butterfly and sting...)

863
00:30:15.897 --> 00:30:17.460
(like a bee.)

864
00:30:17.465 --> 00:30:20.230
- Is this how it's going to be? - What? You lost.

865
00:30:20.235 --> 00:30:21.800
What's wrong with you?

866
00:30:21.803 --> 00:30:23.370
- What's wrong with you? - Why did you do that?

867
00:30:23.371 --> 00:30:25.370
- I didn't think it was number four. - Me neither.

868
00:30:25.373 --> 00:30:26.670
- It was right. - It was.

869
00:30:26.675 --> 00:30:27.670
- I thought it wasn't right. - It's not number one.

870
00:30:27.676 --> 00:30:29.810
- It was the right one. - Why did you hit me?

871
00:30:29.811 --> 00:30:31.580
(Why did he hit him?)

872
00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.675
- I need to hit 4 people? - 4?

873
00:30:33.849 --> 00:30:35.880
- He needs to hit four people. - I do.

874
00:30:35.884 --> 00:30:38.050
(Really?)

875
00:30:38.053 --> 00:30:40.020
- No, I need to hit 3 people. - No, it's 4.

876
00:30:40.021 --> 00:30:41.020
Wait.

877
00:30:41.022 --> 00:30:42.590
(He quickly changes the rules.)

878
00:30:42.591 --> 00:30:43.850
(He doesn't dare to hit Jong Kook.)

879
00:30:43.859 --> 00:30:45.620
- Wait, you changed it. - Hold on.

880
00:30:45.627 --> 00:30:47.360
- Hold on. - I want to hit him.

881
00:30:47.362 --> 00:30:48.990
- It's 4. - No, it's 3.

882
00:30:48.997 --> 00:30:51.160
- No, it's not. - It's three people.

883
00:30:51.166 --> 00:30:52.460
- What do you mean? - Don't be ridiculous.

884
00:30:52.467 --> 00:30:54.000
- It's 4 people. - It's 3 people.

885
00:30:54.002 --> 00:30:55.330
Forget it. It's three.

886
00:30:55.337 --> 00:30:56.900
- It's 4. - No, it's 3.

887
00:30:56.905 --> 00:30:58.270
- No, it's 4. - No, I want 3.

888
00:30:58.273 --> 00:31:00.800
- Just make it four. - I don't want to.

889
00:31:00.809 --> 00:31:02.540
(He dodges it.)

890
00:31:02.544 --> 00:31:04.170
- He dodged it. - Let it go.

891
00:31:04.179 --> 00:31:05.845
Let it go.

892
00:31:06.314 --> 00:31:09.280
- Let it go. - He dodged it? Gosh.

893
00:31:09.284 --> 00:31:10.510
Fine, then.

894
00:31:10.518 --> 00:31:13.180
Did you see Seok Jin?

895
00:31:13.188 --> 00:31:14.180
He was afraid he'd get hit.

896
00:31:14.189 --> 00:31:16.390
(He surrendered.)

897
00:31:16.391 --> 00:31:18.690
- Okay, then. - That was hilarious.

898
00:31:18.693 --> 00:31:20.490
- Let's go with eight. - All right.

899
00:31:20.495 --> 00:31:22.460
- We choose 8. - 8, it is.

900
00:31:22.464 --> 00:31:24.060
- Shall we do both cups? - Sure.

901
00:31:24.065 --> 00:31:26.200
- Should I go? - There's no dud there.

902
00:31:26.201 --> 00:31:27.530
- Okay. - Yes!

903
00:31:27.535 --> 00:31:28.830
- Go! - Go!

904
00:31:28.837 --> 00:31:30.500
- It's a given. - Okay!

905
00:31:30.505 --> 00:31:31.670
- Six points. - Go?

906
00:31:31.673 --> 00:31:33.335
- Go! - Go!

907
00:31:33.441 --> 00:31:35.435
- Okay! - Yes!

908
00:31:35.644 --> 00:31:37.340
- Seven points. - Let's do one more.

909
00:31:37.345 --> 00:31:39.010
- Let's do one more. - Sure.

910
00:31:39.014 --> 00:31:40.110
- Let's go. - That's enough.

911
00:31:40.115 --> 00:31:41.910
- Let's go. - Calm down.

912
00:31:41.917 --> 00:31:43.550
Ji Hyo, let's go once more.

913
00:31:43.551 --> 00:31:45.620
- We should continue. - We should stop.

914
00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:46.650
- Let's go. - Let's stop.

915
00:31:46.655 --> 00:31:47.980
- You're the team leader. - Let's continue.

916
00:31:47.989 --> 00:31:49.750
- Don't forget that. - Go on.

917
00:31:49.758 --> 00:31:51.490
- Ji Hyo. - Let's go.

918
00:31:51.493 --> 00:31:52.790
- 9. - 9.

919
00:31:52.794 --> 00:31:54.520
- Okay. - If we get more points,

920
00:31:54.529 --> 00:31:56.160
- let's stop here. - Okay.

921
00:31:56.164 --> 00:31:57.760
- 1, 2, 3. - It must be 8 points.

922
00:31:57.766 --> 00:31:59.635
(Ji Hyo, who's always lucky, decides to continue.)

923
00:31:59.935 --> 00:32:02.935
(They wish for it to be a dud.)

924
00:32:03.071 --> 00:32:07.470
(Did she make the right choice?)

925
00:32:07.475 --> 00:32:09.170
- Okay. - What a relief.

926
00:32:09.177 --> 00:32:11.110
(They receive 1 more point.)

927
00:32:11.112 --> 00:32:13.380
- We got a point. - Let's do one more.

928
00:32:13.381 --> 00:32:15.110
- They've picked seven. - Last pick.

929
00:32:15.116 --> 00:32:16.380
- Okay, seven. - This will be our last one.

930
00:32:16.384 --> 00:32:18.010
- Are you sure? - Seven.

931
00:32:18.019 --> 00:32:19.780
- Let's do it. It'll be all right. - 1, 2...

932
00:32:19.788 --> 00:32:21.415
1, 2, 3.

933
00:32:21.589 --> 00:32:24.290
(No one has picked 7 before.)

934
00:32:24.292 --> 00:32:28.690
(Will it be a lucky 7 or a tragic 7?)

935
00:32:28.697 --> 00:32:30.090
- 1, 2, 3. - Okay!

936
00:32:30.098 --> 00:32:31.090
- Let's stop here. - Let's stop.

937
00:32:31.099 --> 00:32:32.600
- Great. - Amazing.

938
00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.735
- This is amazing. - 1, 2, 3.

939
00:32:34.769 --> 00:32:37.230
(Team Ace gets 10 points.)

940
00:32:37.238 --> 00:32:39.670
- Stop it. I'm so anxious. - All right.

941
00:32:39.674 --> 00:32:41.000
- 10 points. - 10 points.

942
00:32:41.009 --> 00:32:43.470
Look at what you've done.

943
00:32:43.478 --> 00:32:45.680
- What have you done? - We received 10 points.

944
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.340
We could've gotten it.

945
00:32:47.349 --> 00:32:49.210
- Of course, it was number four. - He's telling him off.

946
00:32:49.217 --> 00:32:51.820
- Stop. - Fine. What's done is done.

947
00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.480
Sit down, Kwang Soo. Let's do this.

948
00:32:53.488 --> 00:32:55.315
Next question.

949
00:32:55.457 --> 00:32:58.250
The difference in 12 years of age is called zodiac similarity.

950
00:32:58.259 --> 00:32:59.790
- Right. - Correct.

951
00:32:59.794 --> 00:33:03.230
Then what's the word for...

952
00:33:03.231 --> 00:33:04.630
- one-year difference? - I know this one.

953
00:33:04.632 --> 00:33:06.600
- I know this. - This one's easy.

954
00:33:06.601 --> 00:33:09.465
One, "knee similarity".

955
00:33:09.471 --> 00:33:12.135
Two, "shoulder similarity".

956
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.370
Three, "eyebrow similarity".

957
00:33:14.376 --> 00:33:15.970
Four, "head similarity".

958
00:33:15.977 --> 00:33:17.945
Let me answer!

959
00:33:18.446 --> 00:33:20.610
(Hesitant, Haha raises his hand.)

960
00:33:20.615 --> 00:33:22.180
What is the answer?

961
00:33:22.183 --> 00:33:23.880
- What? - Don't you know everything?

962
00:33:23.885 --> 00:33:26.650
- I'm not sure. Maybe three? - I don't know either.

963
00:33:26.654 --> 00:33:31.250
I think it's either eyebrow or ankle. Let's do eyebrow.

964
00:33:31.259 --> 00:33:32.820
- There was no ankle. - It's knee.

965
00:33:32.827 --> 00:33:34.460
- It's knee. - There was no ankle.

966
00:33:34.462 --> 00:33:35.990
- I'm baffled. - That's like a ghost.

967
00:33:35.997 --> 00:33:38.830
There's no ankle. Four was "head similarity".

968
00:33:38.833 --> 00:33:41.495
- Pick 3. - 3, "eyebrow similarity".

969
00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:43.335
That's the right one.

970
00:33:43.471 --> 00:33:44.670
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

971
00:33:44.672 --> 00:33:46.100
We need to hit them first.

972
00:33:46.107 --> 00:33:47.100
- Hit them. - Do that first.

973
00:33:47.108 --> 00:33:48.570
You should do it.

974
00:33:48.576 --> 00:33:49.840
Give it back later.

975
00:33:49.844 --> 00:33:51.540
(Who is his target?)

976
00:33:51.546 --> 00:33:53.140
What was the second choice?

977
00:33:53.148 --> 00:33:55.375
(He finds his target.)

978
00:33:56.217 --> 00:33:57.550
- Come on. - What do you mean?

979
00:33:57.552 --> 00:33:59.450
- Take off your hat. - Oh, okay.

980
00:33:59.454 --> 00:34:02.755
(He makes sure to teach him a lesson.)

981
00:34:03.391 --> 00:34:04.690
(Hitting)

982
00:34:04.692 --> 00:34:06.660
- Wait. - What's wrong?

983
00:34:06.661 --> 00:34:10.165
(Why is he hitting me?)

984
00:34:10.899 --> 00:34:12.100
- Jong Kook! - What's going on?

985
00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:13.800
- Jae Seok! - What?

986
00:34:13.802 --> 00:34:15.170
- What was that? - What did you do?

987
00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:16.600
- What? - Why did you hit me?

988
00:34:16.604 --> 00:34:18.300
- How could you do that? - What's wrong?

989
00:34:18.306 --> 00:34:19.540
You're impossible.

990
00:34:19.541 --> 00:34:21.240
- He hit me! - Hey.

991
00:34:21.242 --> 00:34:23.270
- How could you? - It's not him.

992
00:34:23.278 --> 00:34:24.710
- How could you? - Wait.

993
00:34:24.712 --> 00:34:26.240
(While walking towards Jae Seok,)

994
00:34:26.247 --> 00:34:27.280
(Jong Kook makes an abrupt turn.)

995
00:34:27.282 --> 00:34:29.150
- It's not him. - How could you?

996
00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:30.910
(When a junior makes a mistake, his senior should take the blame.)

997
00:34:30.919 --> 00:34:33.020
- How many more hits? One? - Wait.

998
00:34:33.021 --> 00:34:35.150
- What's going on? - Okay.

999
00:34:35.156 --> 00:34:36.820
- How could you do this? - Hey.

1000
00:34:36.825 --> 00:34:37.820
Goodness.

1001
00:34:37.826 --> 00:34:39.690
(He's been hit 5 times today.)

1002
00:34:39.694 --> 00:34:40.920
You won't get away with this!

1003
00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:43.090
(You should respect me.)

1004
00:34:43.098 --> 00:34:45.965
(What?)

1005
00:34:46.468 --> 00:34:47.930
How could you?

1006
00:34:47.936 --> 00:34:49.370
(He places his glasses upside down.)

1007
00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:51.030
How could you?

1008
00:34:51.039 --> 00:34:53.070
- Okay. - You've changed your glasses.

1009
00:34:53.074 --> 00:34:55.410
- All right. - You changed your style.

1010
00:34:55.410 --> 00:34:57.470
Let me hit him next.

1011
00:34:57.479 --> 00:34:59.280
- Sure, you can. - Let me answer.

1012
00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.380
- Let me answer. - All right.

1013
00:35:00.381 --> 00:35:03.585
- Two, "shoulder similarity". - "Shoulder similarity".

1014
00:35:04.185 --> 00:35:05.780
Okay!

1015
00:35:05.787 --> 00:35:07.120
It was the shoulder.

1016
00:35:07.122 --> 00:35:08.950
My brother and I are one-year apart.

1017
00:35:08.957 --> 00:35:11.720
- Because they're of similar height. - I get it.

1018
00:35:11.726 --> 00:35:14.320
They got 10 points. We have to get this.

1019
00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:15.590
You won't have our luck.

1020
00:35:15.597 --> 00:35:17.790
- Please. Pick 2. - We got 10 points.

1021
00:35:17.799 --> 00:35:19.400
- I think it's 4. - No, it's 2.

1022
00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.960
- I think... - I think it's two.

1023
00:35:20.969 --> 00:35:22.730
Was this the one they picked?

1024
00:35:22.737 --> 00:35:24.800
Yes, it's seven. Should we pick that...

1025
00:35:24.806 --> 00:35:26.770
- and then pick another one? - I think we can pick that one.

1026
00:35:26.774 --> 00:35:29.070
- I don't think it'll be a dud. - Me neither.

1027
00:35:29.077 --> 00:35:31.070
It has to be a dud.

1028
00:35:31.079 --> 00:35:33.275
The second one can't be a dud.

1029
00:35:33.381 --> 00:35:34.610
What do you think?

1030
00:35:34.616 --> 00:35:36.110
Let's trust Se Chan.

1031
00:35:36.117 --> 00:35:38.680
- 7. - We'll open 7.

1032
00:35:38.686 --> 00:35:41.185
I doubt it'll be a dud.

1033
00:35:41.789 --> 00:35:42.790
- It's a dud. - It's a dud.

1034
00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:46.390
(Team Champion needs to catch up.)

1035
00:35:46.394 --> 00:35:49.490
(Will they be able to avoid the dud?)

1036
00:35:49.497 --> 00:35:50.690
- Okay! - Okay!

1037
00:35:50.698 --> 00:35:53.735
(They receive 3 points.)

1038
00:35:53.835 --> 00:35:54.830
(Let's catch up now.)

1039
00:35:54.836 --> 00:35:56.130
- Let's continue. - It'll work out.

1040
00:35:56.137 --> 00:35:57.800
- Let's do 4. - Let's do 2.

1041
00:35:57.805 --> 00:35:59.400
- Let's do 4. - I'm not sure about 4.

1042
00:35:59.407 --> 00:36:01.370
- We should pick 2. - 2?

1043
00:36:01.376 --> 00:36:02.470
It won't be a dud from the start.

1044
00:36:02.477 --> 00:36:04.840
- Did you pick four? - Hold on.

1045
00:36:04.846 --> 00:36:08.280
Jae Seok touched the fourth one.

1046
00:36:08.283 --> 00:36:10.680
And Kwang Soo also wanted to pick four.

1047
00:36:10.685 --> 00:36:12.180
- Right. - Jae Seok touched it.

1048
00:36:12.187 --> 00:36:15.285
(4 seems ominous.)

1049
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:17.450
It does feel like you shouldn't pick that one.

1050
00:36:17.458 --> 00:36:19.595
They both wanted four.

1051
00:36:19.861 --> 00:36:21.390
I'm not sure.

1052
00:36:21.396 --> 00:36:22.860
- Wait. - Okay.

1053
00:36:22.864 --> 00:36:24.790
We listened to Se Chan and picked seven.

1054
00:36:24.799 --> 00:36:26.160
- So pick yours. - I'll...

1055
00:36:26.167 --> 00:36:28.100
- I'll pick four. - All right, then.

1056
00:36:28.102 --> 00:36:30.270
- It feels ominous. - 2, 3.

1057
00:36:30.271 --> 00:36:32.970
(Cup number 4 is the one Jae Seok touched...)

1058
00:36:32.974 --> 00:36:36.905
(and Kwang Soo picked.)

1059
00:36:37.378 --> 00:36:39.180
(Will this go against their expectations?)

1060
00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:44.385
(Will it give them points instead of a dud?)

1061
00:36:45.987 --> 00:36:49.220
- Dud! - It's like a miracle.

1062
00:36:49.224 --> 00:36:50.720
I can't believe this.

1063
00:36:50.725 --> 00:36:54.520
(Just like Kwang Soo, the cup turns out to be a dud.)

1064
00:36:54.529 --> 00:36:56.260
- It's a dud. - I'm sorry.

1065
00:36:56.264 --> 00:36:57.490
(He regrets believing in him.)

1066
00:36:57.498 --> 00:36:59.530
- I'm sorry. - You should've listened to me.

1067
00:36:59.534 --> 00:37:00.830
- It's over. - I'm sorry.

1068
00:37:00.835 --> 00:37:03.470
- I can't believe this. - This is impossible.

1069
00:37:03.471 --> 00:37:05.600
- How could that happen? - My goodness.

1070
00:37:05.607 --> 00:37:07.500
(None of them can believe it.)

1071
00:37:07.508 --> 00:37:08.970
- You know what? - It's so strange.

1072
00:37:08.977 --> 00:37:11.870
- I picked four as well. - How could this happen?

1073
00:37:11.879 --> 00:37:13.880
- I picked four as well. - Unbelievable.

1074
00:37:13.881 --> 00:37:15.650
- It really is. - Goodness.

1075
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:18.480
- It's amazing. - I know.

1076
00:37:18.486 --> 00:37:20.380
- I can't believe this. - Me neither.

1077
00:37:20.388 --> 00:37:23.090
- It's all over. - How could this be?

1078
00:37:23.091 --> 00:37:25.290
- Okay, it's good for us. - That's why it didn't work out.

1079
00:37:25.293 --> 00:37:27.120
(They fail to gain any points.)

1080
00:37:27.128 --> 00:37:28.890
They have no points, right?

1081
00:37:28.896 --> 00:37:30.290
(Team Ace: 10, Team Champion: 0)

1082
00:37:30.298 --> 00:37:32.800
- We'll try harder next time. - It'll still be hard.

1083
00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.160
Those who frequent the US will have an advantageous.

1084
00:37:35.169 --> 00:37:36.900
- Okay. - That's good.

1085
00:37:36.904 --> 00:37:38.370
Who knows?

1086
00:37:38.373 --> 00:37:41.870
Whose face appears on the front side...

1087
00:37:41.876 --> 00:37:44.470
- of a one-dollar bill? - I know this.

1088
00:37:44.479 --> 00:37:46.680
One, "Abraham Lincoln".

1089
00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:48.610
Two, "Thomas Jefferson".

1090
00:37:48.616 --> 00:37:51.680
Three, "Franklin Delano Roosevelt".

1091
00:37:51.686 --> 00:37:52.950
Four, "George Washington".

1092
00:37:52.954 --> 00:37:54.520
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1093
00:37:54.522 --> 00:37:56.290
- Jae Seok. - Four, "George Washington".

1094
00:37:56.291 --> 00:37:57.590
I'm sure.

1095
00:37:57.592 --> 00:37:59.160
- I'm 100-percent sure. - Isn't it Abraham Lincoln?

1096
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.960
No, it's George Washington.

1097
00:38:00.962 --> 00:38:02.160
(What is the answer?)

1098
00:38:02.163 --> 00:38:03.260
("George Washington" was the correct answer.)

1099
00:38:03.264 --> 00:38:04.860
(They get it right.)

1100
00:38:04.866 --> 00:38:07.030
I've never really looked at it.

1101
00:38:07.035 --> 00:38:09.370
- Please let it be a dud. - I pick four.

1102
00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:10.770
- Four. - No, no.

1103
00:38:10.772 --> 00:38:12.640
- We should pick four. - I think it'll be another dud.

1104
00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.270
- There are no consecutive duds. - He's right.

1105
00:38:14.275 --> 00:38:16.540
- There aren't any. - Who knows?

1106
00:38:16.544 --> 00:38:18.680
- It's possible. - Really?

1107
00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.380
I think it is.

1108
00:38:20.381 --> 00:38:21.780
Really? Which number grabs your attention?

1109
00:38:21.783 --> 00:38:24.785
- Right, you should pick. - Which number?

1110
00:38:24.819 --> 00:38:27.850
- 2. - 2.

1111
00:38:27.855 --> 00:38:31.290
(Neither team chose this number.)

1112
00:38:31.292 --> 00:38:34.660
(Will she be lucky this time as well?)

1113
00:38:34.662 --> 00:38:35.660
- All right. - Two points.

1114
00:38:35.663 --> 00:38:37.090
(She sure is lucky.)

1115
00:38:37.098 --> 00:38:38.825
- All right. - Two points.

1116
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.960
Let's go. Pick again.

1117
00:38:40.968 --> 00:38:43.200
- I told you. - We should've picked two.

1118
00:38:43.204 --> 00:38:45.300
(Team Champion gets gloomier and gloomier.)

1119
00:38:45.306 --> 00:38:47.805
I have no motivation left.

1120
00:38:48.142 --> 00:38:50.140
- 1 more time? - What about number 4?

1121
00:38:50.144 --> 00:38:52.210
- Number four? - Right? No?

1122
00:38:52.213 --> 00:38:53.845
- Number 4. - Number 4.

1123
00:38:53.981 --> 00:38:55.910
(2 unlucky members had chosen number 4.)

1124
00:38:55.917 --> 00:38:57.280
(What will happen this time?)

1125
00:38:57.285 --> 00:38:59.220
- It can't be another dud. - It can't be.

1126
00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.815
(What will happen this time?)

1127
00:39:02.223 --> 00:39:05.360
(Dud)

1128
00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:06.820
It's a dud again.

1129
00:39:06.828 --> 00:39:08.160
- It's a dud again. - It's a dud again.

1130
00:39:08.162 --> 00:39:09.530
- It's another dud. - Okay!

1131
00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:10.530
(We still have hope.)

1132
00:39:10.531 --> 00:39:12.930
- It's a dud again. - It's a dud again.

1133
00:39:12.934 --> 00:39:14.500
Gosh.

1134
00:39:14.502 --> 00:39:17.030
We have to get the question right. All the duds have been removed.

1135
00:39:17.038 --> 00:39:19.000
- We have to. - We can get past them.

1136
00:39:19.006 --> 00:39:22.240
This time, we have to win.

1137
00:39:22.243 --> 00:39:23.270
All right.

1138
00:39:23.277 --> 00:39:25.440
Here is the question.

1139
00:39:25.446 --> 00:39:27.740
"In the ondol system,"

1140
00:39:27.749 --> 00:39:30.010
"what is the passage for fire and smoke..."

1141
00:39:30.017 --> 00:39:32.320
"called?"

1142
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.550
Seok Jin definitely knows it.

1143
00:39:34.555 --> 00:39:36.855
(He has used ondol.)

1144
00:39:36.958 --> 00:39:38.420
For generations...

1145
00:39:38.426 --> 00:39:40.420
His father actually...

1146
00:39:40.428 --> 00:39:41.890
worked for an ondol company.

1147
00:39:41.896 --> 00:39:44.160
(His father worked for an ondol company.)

1148
00:39:44.165 --> 00:39:45.160
He didn't.

1149
00:39:45.166 --> 00:39:46.830
(I can't go along with that.)

1150
00:39:46.834 --> 00:39:47.860
He didn't.

1151
00:39:47.869 --> 00:39:49.470
(Leave my parents alone.)

1152
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:51.865
- Gosh. - Get your facts straight.

1153
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.770
I mean...

1154
00:39:53.775 --> 00:39:56.340
My father didn't.

1155
00:39:56.344 --> 00:39:57.910
He goes along with most jokes,

1156
00:39:57.912 --> 00:39:59.740
but he couldn't this time.

1157
00:39:59.747 --> 00:40:02.010
He changed my father's job.

1158
00:40:02.016 --> 00:40:03.110
(Jokes about family are not accepted.)

1159
00:40:03.117 --> 00:40:05.085
All right. "Number one,"

1160
00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.115
"gorae."

1161
00:40:07.188 --> 00:40:09.220
"Number two, geobuk."

1162
00:40:09.223 --> 00:40:11.990
- "Geobuk"? - "Number three, yeou."

1163
00:40:11.993 --> 00:40:13.260
"Number four, ori."

1164
00:40:13.261 --> 00:40:14.660
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1165
00:40:14.662 --> 00:40:15.660
Number one, "gorae".

1166
00:40:15.663 --> 00:40:16.960
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1167
00:40:16.964 --> 00:40:18.160
Number one, "gorae".

1168
00:40:18.166 --> 00:40:20.160
(It's a chance to win 15 points at once.)

1169
00:40:20.168 --> 00:40:21.360
"Gorae".

1170
00:40:21.369 --> 00:40:22.570
- Okay! - What did I say?

1171
00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:23.830
"Gorae".

1172
00:40:23.838 --> 00:40:25.500
- Trust me. - "Rae" means...

1173
00:40:25.506 --> 00:40:28.040
"Rae" means "passage".

1174
00:40:28.042 --> 00:40:30.210
What a shame. I knew it too.

1175
00:40:30.211 --> 00:40:31.510
This...

1176
00:40:31.512 --> 00:40:33.080
- All of number 4. - All of number 4.

1177
00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.975
- Open it! - It's "gorae".

1178
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:37.010
- Five. - Okay!

1179
00:40:37.018 --> 00:40:39.150
(Their score goes up.)

1180
00:40:39.153 --> 00:40:40.915
- 8. - 8.

1181
00:40:41.322 --> 00:40:42.520
11.

1182
00:40:42.523 --> 00:40:43.520
- 7. - 7.

1183
00:40:43.524 --> 00:40:45.320
(Frustrated)

1184
00:40:45.326 --> 00:40:46.720
(The situation reversed at once.)

1185
00:40:46.727 --> 00:40:48.220
Unbelievable.

1186
00:40:48.229 --> 00:40:49.430
- 11. - 11.

1187
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:50.530
(They win 15 points in total.)

1188
00:40:50.531 --> 00:40:51.730
15 points!

1189
00:40:51.732 --> 00:40:53.060
Nice!

1190
00:40:53.067 --> 00:40:54.160
- Stop! - Stop!

1191
00:40:54.168 --> 00:40:55.800
(We won't repeat the same mistake.)

1192
00:40:55.803 --> 00:40:57.630
(Stop)

1193
00:40:57.638 --> 00:40:58.700
- Go! - Go!

1194
00:40:58.706 --> 00:41:00.200
(They try to egg on their opponent.)

1195
00:41:00.208 --> 00:41:02.370
- You stop here? - Go! Kwang Soo!

1196
00:41:02.376 --> 00:41:04.170
You petty!

1197
00:41:04.178 --> 00:41:05.880
- Just one more round. - Stop!

1198
00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.580
- Just one more. - No. Stop.

1199
00:41:07.582 --> 00:41:09.380
- One more round. - If we make a mistake,

1200
00:41:09.383 --> 00:41:10.810
- we won't be able to recover. - Just one more round.

1201
00:41:10.818 --> 00:41:11.980
We won't be able to recover.

1202
00:41:11.986 --> 00:41:13.480
Okay. We have to win.

1203
00:41:13.488 --> 00:41:14.920
We have to win this time.

1204
00:41:14.922 --> 00:41:16.050
Here we go.

1205
00:41:16.057 --> 00:41:19.155
"The name of this island means..."

1206
00:41:19.293 --> 00:41:22.190
"'a beaming island'."

1207
00:41:22.196 --> 00:41:23.760
- "A beaming island"? - I know this one.

1208
00:41:23.764 --> 00:41:26.030
"Number one, Silmi Island."

1209
00:41:26.033 --> 00:41:28.795
"Number two, Anmyeon Island."

1210
00:41:29.237 --> 00:41:31.800
"Number three, Wan Island."

1211
00:41:31.806 --> 00:41:33.200
"Number four, Jeju Island."

1212
00:41:33.207 --> 00:41:34.370
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1213
00:41:34.375 --> 00:41:36.070
(Team Ace wants to answer right away.)

1214
00:41:36.077 --> 00:41:38.410
- What's your answer? - "Wan Island".

1215
00:41:38.412 --> 00:41:39.740
- "Wan Island"? - "Wan Island"?

1216
00:41:39.747 --> 00:41:41.640
- Isn't it "Anmyeon Island"? - Let me answer!

1217
00:41:41.649 --> 00:41:43.080
(Team Ace is not sure.)

1218
00:41:43.084 --> 00:41:44.885
Number four, "Jeju Island".

1219
00:41:45.186 --> 00:41:49.590
(While other members are not sure, Jae Seok says, "Jeju Island".)

1220
00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:54.520
(If it's correct, the situation might reverse.)

1221
00:41:54.529 --> 00:41:55.590
It's "Wan Island"!

1222
00:41:55.596 --> 00:41:57.295
(Frustrated)

1223
00:41:57.331 --> 00:41:58.430
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1224
00:41:58.432 --> 00:42:01.665
(It's Team Champion's turn.)

1225
00:42:02.904 --> 00:42:04.800
- Isn't it "Wan Island"? - Isn't it "Silmi Island"?

1226
00:42:04.805 --> 00:42:07.400
- I think it's number 3. - Isn't it number 1?

1227
00:42:07.408 --> 00:42:10.570
(Team Champion thinks the correct answer is "Wan Island".)

1228
00:42:10.578 --> 00:42:11.670
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1229
00:42:11.679 --> 00:42:12.840
Number one, "Silmi Island".

1230
00:42:12.847 --> 00:42:13.880
No.

1231
00:42:13.881 --> 00:42:15.980
- It's wrong. - It's wrong?

1232
00:42:15.983 --> 00:42:17.410
(Why did you suddenly say, "Silmi Island"?)

1233
00:42:17.418 --> 00:42:19.150
- It's wrong. - It's wrong?

1234
00:42:19.153 --> 00:42:21.050
It's "Wan Island".

1235
00:42:21.055 --> 00:42:22.650
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

1236
00:42:22.657 --> 00:42:23.650
"Wan Island".

1237
00:42:23.658 --> 00:42:25.450
- What number? - Number Three.

1238
00:42:25.459 --> 00:42:27.125
Number three, "Wan Island".

1239
00:42:27.361 --> 00:42:29.560
(Seok Jin sounds confident. Is it correct?)

1240
00:42:29.564 --> 00:42:32.030
(Correct)

1241
00:42:32.033 --> 00:42:34.665
- We did it! - Nice!

1242
00:42:34.902 --> 00:42:36.530
- We knew it was number three. - Please.

1243
00:42:36.537 --> 00:42:38.365
Please discuss first.

1244
00:42:38.606 --> 00:42:40.240
I said it was "Wan Island" from the beginning.

1245
00:42:40.241 --> 00:42:42.970
- We just need 6 points. - 6 points.

1246
00:42:42.977 --> 00:42:44.540
- Six points. - I'm nervous.

1247
00:42:44.545 --> 00:42:46.675
- I'm nervous. Just six points. - Let's do this.

1248
00:42:46.814 --> 00:42:49.550
- They need six points. - Right.

1249
00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:51.810
They need more than five points,

1250
00:42:51.819 --> 00:42:53.280
so they'll have to keep trying.

1251
00:42:53.287 --> 00:42:54.720
Ji Hyo, just do whatever you want.

1252
00:42:54.722 --> 00:42:55.850
Gosh.

1253
00:42:55.856 --> 00:42:57.250
Just follow your gut.

1254
00:42:57.258 --> 00:42:58.750
Just do it.

1255
00:42:58.759 --> 00:43:01.690
(Will Ji Hyo manage to win more than 6 points?)

1256
00:43:01.696 --> 00:43:03.325
You have golden hands.

1257
00:43:05.199 --> 00:43:06.835
Go.

1258
00:43:06.968 --> 00:43:08.430
- Number 6. - Number 6.

1259
00:43:08.436 --> 00:43:09.700
- Okay. - Number six.

1260
00:43:09.704 --> 00:43:11.030
(No one has touched number 6 yet. What will be the result?)

1261
00:43:11.038 --> 00:43:12.600
- It's not a dud. - It has points.

1262
00:43:12.607 --> 00:43:13.840
- 3 points! - Just 1 more.

1263
00:43:13.841 --> 00:43:15.670
(Amazing)

1264
00:43:15.676 --> 00:43:17.570
- Just 1 more. - Just 1 more.

1265
00:43:17.578 --> 00:43:19.240
- Another 3 points. - Another 3 points.

1266
00:43:19.246 --> 00:43:20.380
- Another 3 points. - This doesn't feel right.

1267
00:43:20.381 --> 00:43:21.480
(If they choose a dud, they'll lose.)

1268
00:43:21.482 --> 00:43:22.910
Either number 1 or 10.

1269
00:43:22.917 --> 00:43:23.910
(They can't seem to decide.)

1270
00:43:23.918 --> 00:43:25.950
Would number seven be a dud?

1271
00:43:25.953 --> 00:43:27.985
I think it's a dud.

1272
00:43:28.456 --> 00:43:30.120
Either a dud or one point.

1273
00:43:30.124 --> 00:43:31.550
Please.

1274
00:43:31.559 --> 00:43:32.860
(What is her next choice?)

1275
00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:34.820
- Just relax. - Okay. I choose number five.

1276
00:43:34.829 --> 00:43:36.825
- Number 5. - Number 5.

1277
00:43:36.964 --> 00:43:38.030
(The ace's guess)

1278
00:43:38.032 --> 00:43:40.435
(Number 5 has not been opened either.)

1279
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:43.500
Three points.

1280
00:43:43.504 --> 00:43:44.570
(Will they catch up?)

1281
00:43:44.572 --> 00:43:45.570
Please. One point.

1282
00:43:45.573 --> 00:43:47.770
(Or is it a dud?)

1283
00:43:47.775 --> 00:43:50.510
- I'll open it. 1, 2, 3. - Please.

1284
00:43:50.511 --> 00:43:51.540
One point.

1285
00:43:51.545 --> 00:43:53.615
(1 point)

1286
00:43:54.315 --> 00:43:56.480
- Okay. - This is not okay.

1287
00:43:56.484 --> 00:43:58.385
I can't do this.

1288
00:43:58.853 --> 00:44:01.180
I'm so nervous.

1289
00:44:01.188 --> 00:44:02.890
(Their life is prolonged.)

1290
00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:04.190
- I'm so nervous. - I can't do this.

1291
00:44:04.191 --> 00:44:05.890
- I don't like it. - My heart is going to burst.

1292
00:44:05.893 --> 00:44:07.160
Ji Hyo.

1293
00:44:07.161 --> 00:44:08.320
- My heart. - Please.

1294
00:44:08.329 --> 00:44:09.690
I'm so nervous.

1295
00:44:09.697 --> 00:44:11.660
- Here it comes. - Please!

1296
00:44:11.666 --> 00:44:13.800
- Here it comes. - Dud!

1297
00:44:13.801 --> 00:44:15.630
Why did it have to be one point?

1298
00:44:15.636 --> 00:44:16.630
- Please. - Here it comes.

1299
00:44:16.637 --> 00:44:19.170
- Dud! - Dud!

1300
00:44:19.173 --> 00:44:21.040
- Dud! - Ji Hyo, please.

1301
00:44:21.042 --> 00:44:22.040
It's up to you.

1302
00:44:22.043 --> 00:44:25.045
(It's all up to the ace now.)

1303
00:44:27.548 --> 00:44:29.980
(She has a hard time making up her mind.)

1304
00:44:29.984 --> 00:44:32.285
Ji Hyo, number 10.

1305
00:44:32.553 --> 00:44:36.355
(Ji Hyo, number 10.)

1306
00:44:36.691 --> 00:44:38.090
(Is he feeling something?)

1307
00:44:38.092 --> 00:44:39.560
(Jae Seok suddenly says, "number 10".)

1308
00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:43.460
(Number 10 has never been opened.)

1309
00:44:43.464 --> 00:44:45.630
- Number 10. - Don't listen. It's a dud.

1310
00:44:45.633 --> 00:44:48.865
(He can't be feeling something.)

1311
00:44:49.503 --> 00:44:51.130
I want them to listen to Jae Seok.

1312
00:44:51.138 --> 00:44:53.005
(The legendary unlucky man)

1313
00:44:53.074 --> 00:44:55.070
(Jae Seok makes Ji Hyo think.)

1314
00:44:55.076 --> 00:44:56.140
I choose number five.

1315
00:44:56.143 --> 00:44:58.270
(She chooses number 5.)

1316
00:44:58.279 --> 00:44:59.680
Number five?

1317
00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.210
- Please! - Number five?

1318
00:45:01.215 --> 00:45:02.580
- Number 5? - Suddenly number 5?

1319
00:45:02.583 --> 00:45:03.750
Let's go.

1320
00:45:03.751 --> 00:45:04.910
- Number five. - Kwang Soo, please!

1321
00:45:04.919 --> 00:45:06.785
- Number five. - Kwang Soo!

1322
00:45:06.887 --> 00:45:07.920
Kwang Soo!

1323
00:45:07.922 --> 00:45:09.785
If it's not a dud, we lose.

1324
00:45:10.124 --> 00:45:11.755
Kwang Soo, please!

1325
00:45:12.193 --> 00:45:13.390
Let's go!

1326
00:45:13.394 --> 00:45:15.125
(They're only one point apart.)

1327
00:45:15.496 --> 00:45:16.960
I'll open it.

1328
00:45:16.964 --> 00:45:18.595
One,

1329
00:45:18.632 --> 00:45:19.630
two...

1330
00:45:19.633 --> 00:45:22.570
(How will this tight game end?)

1331
00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:23.570
Three.

1332
00:45:23.571 --> 00:45:24.630
(2 points)

1333
00:45:24.638 --> 00:45:27.505
(She sure is the ace.)

1334
00:45:27.742 --> 00:45:30.910
(Final score, 16:15)

1335
00:45:30.911 --> 00:45:34.710
(Team Ace wins.)

1336
00:45:34.715 --> 00:45:37.685
(Unbelievable)

1337
00:45:38.052 --> 00:45:40.455
(Is it my fault?)

1338
00:45:40.654 --> 00:45:42.220
- Ji Hyo! - I knew it.

1339
00:45:42.223 --> 00:45:43.250
(Ji Hyo made the right choice.)

1340
00:45:43.257 --> 00:45:44.850
- Okay. - What's number 10?

1341
00:45:44.859 --> 00:45:46.120
Number 10?

1342
00:45:46.127 --> 00:45:47.890
- I chose number 10. - See?

1343
00:45:47.895 --> 00:45:49.560
(Jae Seok's choice, number 10, is a dud.)

1344
00:45:49.563 --> 00:45:52.960
(How do you do this?)

1345
00:45:52.967 --> 00:45:55.930
(Good that they didn't listen to him.)

1346
00:45:55.936 --> 00:45:58.535
Please listen to Jae Seok.

1347
00:45:58.773 --> 00:46:01.240
It's okay. We did well.

1348
00:46:01.242 --> 00:46:03.770
Okay! We won first round!

1349
00:46:03.778 --> 00:46:06.240
(Team Ace wins Round 1.)

1350
00:46:06.247 --> 00:46:08.140
- Yes! - We fought well.

1351
00:46:08.149 --> 00:46:09.950
I can't believe it.

1352
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:13.780
(Team Ace: 5 slots, Team Champion:1 slot)

1353
00:46:13.788 --> 00:46:15.890
(The historic competition gets fiercer and fiercer.)

1354
00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:18.120
(What is the next game?)

1355
00:46:18.125 --> 00:46:20.060
Players are entering!

1356
00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:21.755
Let's go!

1357
00:46:21.929 --> 00:46:23.390
Ji Hyo is unbelievable.

1358
00:46:23.397 --> 00:46:24.660
She is...

1359
00:46:24.665 --> 00:46:28.060
More than 1 person wanted to choose number 10.

1360
00:46:28.068 --> 00:46:30.000
She is incredible.

1361
00:46:30.004 --> 00:46:31.530
Here is the Round Two.

1362
00:46:31.539 --> 00:46:34.800
Each team starts with five slots on the roulette wheel each.

1363
00:46:34.809 --> 00:46:37.640
In each round, you bet a number of slots.

1364
00:46:37.645 --> 00:46:40.980
The winning team of the round wins as many slots as they bet.

1365
00:46:40.981 --> 00:46:44.280
After hearing the keyword of each round, the team leaders will...

1366
00:46:44.285 --> 00:46:47.350
select players for that round...

1367
00:46:47.354 --> 00:46:51.320
and decide how many slots they will bet on those players.

1368
00:46:51.325 --> 00:46:52.690
Who can I trust?

1369
00:46:52.693 --> 00:46:55.325
Jong Kook hates thinking.

1370
00:46:55.696 --> 00:46:57.895
Here are the keywords.

1371
00:46:57.965 --> 00:46:59.600
First round, "water".

1372
00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.430
Second round, "fire".

1373
00:47:01.435 --> 00:47:03.765
Third round, "foot".

1374
00:47:04.271 --> 00:47:05.400
- Ji Hyo. - Yes?

1375
00:47:05.406 --> 00:47:06.940
Do you want to choose me for "water"?

1376
00:47:06.941 --> 00:47:09.810
- Okay. - Can't team leaders participate?

1377
00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:11.510
- They can. - They can.

1378
00:47:11.512 --> 00:47:13.680
Ji Hyo should play too.

1379
00:47:13.681 --> 00:47:15.580
(We need our ace to play.)

1380
00:47:15.583 --> 00:47:17.780
(Who will play for Team Ace?)

1381
00:47:17.785 --> 00:47:19.350
"Fire" might mean...

1382
00:47:19.353 --> 00:47:20.850
spicy food.

1383
00:47:20.855 --> 00:47:22.080
I can't eat spicy food.

1384
00:47:22.089 --> 00:47:23.220
- Right. - Right?

1385
00:47:23.224 --> 00:47:26.220
(They have to guess the games and select the right players.)

1386
00:47:26.227 --> 00:47:28.260
- Bet a lot on me. - Hold on.

1387
00:47:28.262 --> 00:47:30.460
(You trust me, right?)

1388
00:47:30.464 --> 00:47:31.960
(I love your confidence.)

1389
00:47:31.966 --> 00:47:33.960
Jong Kook for "foot" and Kwang Soo for "water".

1390
00:47:33.968 --> 00:47:35.360
We have to win this round.

1391
00:47:35.369 --> 00:47:37.870
- Next round... - We have to win.

1392
00:47:37.872 --> 00:47:39.000
Let's start.

1393
00:47:39.006 --> 00:47:40.570
(They have selected players and made bets.)

1394
00:47:40.574 --> 00:47:43.570
The keyword for the first round is "water".

1395
00:47:43.577 --> 00:47:44.740
The game is called...

1396
00:47:44.745 --> 00:47:47.845
Ball over the Water.

1397
00:47:48.215 --> 00:47:50.210
Blow the team's ping-pong ball.

1398
00:47:50.217 --> 00:47:51.880
The ball can only move...

1399
00:47:51.886 --> 00:47:54.120
to the cups in the team's color or white cups.

1400
00:47:54.121 --> 00:47:57.655
The team whose ball gets to the last cup first wins.

1401
00:47:58.759 --> 00:48:00.620
(It sounds hard.)

1402
00:48:00.628 --> 00:48:01.820
Jae Seok...

1403
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:03.825
Let's hope they didn't choose Se Chan.

1404
00:48:04.498 --> 00:48:06.330
- Gosh. - It sounds hard.

1405
00:48:06.333 --> 00:48:07.500
(Who are the players?)

1406
00:48:07.501 --> 00:48:09.600
- Let me introduce the players. - Okay.

1407
00:48:09.603 --> 00:48:12.070
Yu Jae Seok for Team Ace.

1408
00:48:12.072 --> 00:48:13.070
(Team Ace chose Jae Seok.)

1409
00:48:13.073 --> 00:48:15.640
(Good that his mouth sticks out.)

1410
00:48:15.643 --> 00:48:16.810
For Team Champion...

1411
00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:19.040
(Team Champion)

1412
00:48:19.046 --> 00:48:21.015
Lee Kwang Soo.

1413
00:48:21.315 --> 00:48:22.580
(The cheater brothers will compete.)

1414
00:48:22.583 --> 00:48:23.980
I knew it'd be Kwang Soo.

1415
00:48:23.984 --> 00:48:25.510
(The cheater brothers will compete.)

1416
00:48:25.519 --> 00:48:28.480
(Every time they compete, something dirty happens.)

1417
00:48:28.489 --> 00:48:31.950
(The two are known for playing dirty.)

1418
00:48:31.959 --> 00:48:34.360
(They focus more on playing dirty than winning.)

1419
00:48:34.361 --> 00:48:36.730
(What will they do today?)

1420
00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:39.130
Okay. It'll be a dirty game.

1421
00:48:39.133 --> 00:48:40.200
- We'll... - All right.

1422
00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.300
- Kwang Soo. - Okay.

1423
00:48:41.302 --> 00:48:43.100
Today you can be as dirty...

1424
00:48:43.103 --> 00:48:44.700
- as you want. - Okay.

1425
00:48:44.705 --> 00:48:45.900
(You can be dirty too.)

1426
00:48:45.906 --> 00:48:48.770
- It's your day. - I choose the color green.

1427
00:48:48.776 --> 00:48:51.845
(Team Ace's Yu Jae Seok versus Team Champion's Lee Kwang Soo)

1428
00:48:52.046 --> 00:48:53.610
This cup?

1429
00:48:53.614 --> 00:48:55.480
We have to get there first? Okay.

1430
00:48:55.482 --> 00:48:56.810
You have to go diagonally.

1431
00:48:56.817 --> 00:48:59.285
1, 2, 3, 4. Do you understand?

1432
00:48:59.853 --> 00:49:01.380
We have advantage. Our player's mouth sticks out more.

1433
00:49:01.388 --> 00:49:03.250
Ready.

1434
00:49:03.257 --> 00:49:05.320
(The "water" game starts.)

1435
00:49:05.326 --> 00:49:06.995
Okay.

1436
00:49:07.027 --> 00:49:09.260
(Jae Seok cheats as soon as the game starts.)

1437
00:49:09.263 --> 00:49:11.825
He blew the other team's ball.

1438
00:49:11.932 --> 00:49:12.960
No.

1439
00:49:12.967 --> 00:49:14.030
(I stopped Kwang Soo.)

1440
00:49:14.034 --> 00:49:15.730
Good. Kwang Soo is doing well.

1441
00:49:15.736 --> 00:49:18.200
(Kwang Soo's ball moves on to the next cup.)

1442
00:49:18.205 --> 00:49:20.740
(Keep going!)

1443
00:49:20.741 --> 00:49:23.310
(But he fails to move the ball to the next cup.)

1444
00:49:23.310 --> 00:49:25.110
You should fill the cup with more water.

1445
00:49:25.112 --> 00:49:26.680
- Fill the cup. - There's not enough water.

1446
00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:27.710
There you go.

1447
00:49:27.715 --> 00:49:29.445
Kwang Soo, stop.

1448
00:49:29.583 --> 00:49:31.380
(I think it's coming.)

1449
00:49:31.385 --> 00:49:34.250
(The cheating spirit is coming.)

1450
00:49:34.254 --> 00:49:36.950
Here it comes.

1451
00:49:36.957 --> 00:49:38.990
(The cheating spirit fills him.)

1452
00:49:38.993 --> 00:49:40.160
- He used his hand. - No.

1453
00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:41.160
His hand...

1454
00:49:41.161 --> 00:49:43.760
(He touched the ball.)

1455
00:49:43.764 --> 00:49:44.830
(Frustrated)

1456
00:49:44.832 --> 00:49:46.730
- His hand... - It wasn't intentional.

1457
00:49:46.734 --> 00:49:48.830
I didn't do it on purpose.

1458
00:49:48.836 --> 00:49:50.270
You can't blow the other's ball.

1459
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:51.870
You can't, right?

1460
00:49:51.872 --> 00:49:54.835
- Kwang Soo used his hand. - He didn't mean to.

1461
00:49:54.842 --> 00:49:58.240
(They're still near the starting line.)

1462
00:49:58.245 --> 00:49:59.905
Relax.

1463
00:50:00.247 --> 00:50:02.075
Put your hand away.

1464
00:50:02.249 --> 00:50:04.280
(Jong Kook protects the ball with his hand.)

1465
00:50:04.284 --> 00:50:05.280
(Blowing)

1466
00:50:05.285 --> 00:50:06.880
There you go!

1467
00:50:06.887 --> 00:50:09.585
It worked! The ball moved over.

1468
00:50:09.656 --> 00:50:12.055
(Good job, Jae Seok.)

1469
00:50:12.726 --> 00:50:14.460
Okay. Good.

1470
00:50:14.461 --> 00:50:16.730
(Jae Seok keeps moving forward.)

1471
00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:18.330
(Continue to the last cup.)

1472
00:50:18.332 --> 00:50:19.995
Good. Keep going.

1473
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.430
(I can't let you.)

1474
00:50:22.436 --> 00:50:23.470
Keep going.

1475
00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:25.030
(The cheater brothers...)

1476
00:50:25.039 --> 00:50:28.505
(play dirty as always.)

1477
00:50:29.076 --> 00:50:31.805
- My goodness. - It's flooding here.

1478
00:50:32.012 --> 00:50:35.015
(Flooding)

1479
00:50:35.983 --> 00:50:37.450
Is this how this game is played?

1480
00:50:37.451 --> 00:50:38.510
(Is this how this game is played?)

1481
00:50:38.519 --> 00:50:40.850
(Yes, it is.)

1482
00:50:40.854 --> 00:50:42.680
The game is too dirty.

1483
00:50:42.689 --> 00:50:45.125
- He did it! Kwang Soo! - He did it!

1484
00:50:45.259 --> 00:50:47.960
(Kwang Soo pulls himself together and moves forward.)

1485
00:50:47.961 --> 00:50:50.330
- He did it! Kwang Soo! - He did it!

1486
00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:51.660
He did it! When did you come this far?

1487
00:50:51.665 --> 00:50:53.060
- He's here! - Let's go.

1488
00:50:53.067 --> 00:50:54.430
Good. We can win.

1489
00:50:54.435 --> 00:50:56.100
(Will you get out of my way?)

1490
00:50:56.103 --> 00:50:58.035
(I don't think so.)

1491
00:50:58.172 --> 00:51:01.075
(Jae Seok splashes water on Kwang Soo.)

1492
00:51:01.108 --> 00:51:05.710
(It's as if they're playing the game in the water.)

1493
00:51:05.712 --> 00:51:07.440
- Jae Seok, why don't you come here? - Okay.

1494
00:51:07.448 --> 00:51:09.775
- Come here. - I'll try.

1495
00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:11.950
- Almost there. - Come here.

1496
00:51:11.952 --> 00:51:13.820
Good. Kwang Soo, just one more.

1497
00:51:13.821 --> 00:51:15.420
Kwang Soo, you can do this.

1498
00:51:15.422 --> 00:51:16.450
- Gosh. - Blow lightly.

1499
00:51:16.457 --> 00:51:17.450
Put your head away.

1500
00:51:17.458 --> 00:51:18.990
(Jae Seok hasn't moved.)

1501
00:51:18.992 --> 00:51:20.490
You're almost there.

1502
00:51:20.494 --> 00:51:22.620
- Okay! - Just one more!

1503
00:51:22.629 --> 00:51:24.660
(Kwang Soo's ball is only one cup away from the destination.)

1504
00:51:24.665 --> 00:51:26.930
- Good! Kwang Soo, just one more! - You can do this.

1505
00:51:26.934 --> 00:51:27.930
Just one more!

1506
00:51:27.935 --> 00:51:30.200
- Kwang Soo. - No.

1507
00:51:30.204 --> 00:51:31.430
Stop him.

1508
00:51:31.438 --> 00:51:33.300
(Jae Seok falls behind.)

1509
00:51:33.307 --> 00:51:35.400
Jae Seok, stop him!

1510
00:51:35.409 --> 00:51:36.410
(There is only one cup left.)

1511
00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:37.510
Kwang Soo, focus.

1512
00:51:37.511 --> 00:51:42.240
(With Jae Seok lagging behind, I'll finish the game.)

1513
00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:00.834
(What?)

1514
00:52:00.834 --> 00:52:02.503
He did it!

1515
00:52:03.303 --> 00:52:06.173
(Jae Seok moved over 3 cups at once...)

1516
00:52:06.173 --> 00:52:08.375
(and finished the game.)

1517
00:52:08.375 --> 00:52:12.412
(He blew hard enough to move over 3 cups.)

1518
00:52:12.412 --> 00:52:15.682
(It's so thrilling to come from behind and win.)

1519
00:52:16.783 --> 00:52:19.186
(Shocked)

1520
00:52:19.186 --> 00:52:20.754
Why weren't you blowing?

1521
00:52:20.754 --> 00:52:23.090
I couldn't see anything because of the water in my eyes.

1522
00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:26.493
(Team Champion loses.)

1523
00:52:26.493 --> 00:52:28.262
- I did it! - Hey.

1524
00:52:28.262 --> 00:52:30.030
Hold on. Where did it come from?

1525
00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:32.332
(Let me analyze my winning factors.)

1526
00:52:32.399 --> 00:52:33.500
(His protruding mouth helped.)

1527
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:34.935
It jumped so high.

1528
00:52:34.935 --> 00:52:37.604
(Thanks to his mouth, he could blow hard.)

1529
00:52:37.871 --> 00:52:39.540
This is amazing.

1530
00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:43.477
Team Ace wins the first round.

1531
00:52:43.544 --> 00:52:45.445
How many did they bet? That's important.

1532
00:52:45.445 --> 00:52:47.881
Let me tell you how many slots they bet.

1533
00:52:47.881 --> 00:52:49.082
- I hope it's 1. - Is it more than 2?

1534
00:52:49.082 --> 00:52:52.819
(How many slots did Team Ace bet on Jae Seok?)

1535
00:52:52.819 --> 00:52:53.854
3 slots.

1536
00:52:53.854 --> 00:52:55.355
(Team Ace wins 3 slots.)

1537
00:52:55.355 --> 00:52:57.157
(It was a good idea.)

1538
00:52:57.324 --> 00:52:58.792
We bet three slots.

1539
00:52:58.792 --> 00:53:00.994
Hold on. They bet three slots on Jae Seok only?

1540
00:53:00.994 --> 00:53:02.829
- How could they do that? - Three slots on Jae Seok?

1541
00:53:02.829 --> 00:53:04.231
Look at my team.

1542
00:53:04.231 --> 00:53:07.100
(You'll understand.)

1543
00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:09.203
(There are not many to rely on.)

1544
00:53:09.203 --> 00:53:10.604
He won, so I can't say anything.

1545
00:53:10.604 --> 00:53:13.740
Other than Jae Seok, there are not many...

1546
00:53:13.774 --> 00:53:15.409
- There are not... - We're like that.

1547
00:53:15.409 --> 00:53:17.511
- My team is like that. - We're like that.

1548
00:53:17.511 --> 00:53:20.914
The keyword for the second round is "fire".

1549
00:53:20.914 --> 00:53:23.650
The game is called One Candle.

1550
00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:25.819
(One Candle)

1551
00:53:25.819 --> 00:53:28.222
Hold a candle in one hand, and a plate in the other.

1552
00:53:28.222 --> 00:53:32.259
Put out the other's candle using your plate, and you win.

1553
00:53:32.492 --> 00:53:35.696
If you put out your own candle by mistake, you lose.

1554
00:53:35.696 --> 00:53:36.863
- Be careful. - It sounds fun.

1555
00:53:36.863 --> 00:53:39.132
You should have played this. You're so tall.

1556
00:53:39.132 --> 00:53:40.434
No one could have reached his candle.

1557
00:53:40.434 --> 00:53:42.302
(It could have protected my candle perfectly.)

1558
00:53:42.369 --> 00:53:44.838
If Kwang Soo played this, he would have won.

1559
00:53:45.105 --> 00:53:46.106
(We chose the wrong players.)

1560
00:53:46.106 --> 00:53:47.941
- It's a shame. - We chose the wrong players.

1561
00:53:47.941 --> 00:53:50.744
Let me introduce the players for the second round.

1562
00:53:50.744 --> 00:53:53.013
For Team Champion,

1563
00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:54.881
Jeon So Min.

1564
00:53:54.881 --> 00:53:55.882
Okay.

1565
00:53:55.882 --> 00:53:57.851
(So Min is the weakest one.)

1566
00:53:57.851 --> 00:53:59.219
- It's okay. You can do it. - And...

1567
00:53:59.219 --> 00:54:00.621
- for Team Ace... - We'll win.

1568
00:54:00.621 --> 00:54:02.422
(Who will compete against So Min?)

1569
00:54:02.422 --> 00:54:04.191
Song Ji Hyo.

1570
00:54:04.191 --> 00:54:06.026
How did we choose these two?

1571
00:54:06.026 --> 00:54:07.094
Good.

1572
00:54:07.094 --> 00:54:08.795
Unbelievable.

1573
00:54:09.796 --> 00:54:16.370
(Ji Hyo beat So Min twice in the past.)

1574
00:54:16.570 --> 00:54:23.410
(Will So Min be able to stop Ji Hyo's winning streak?)

1575
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:25.812
- We still have a chance. - So Min.

1576
00:54:25.812 --> 00:54:28.215
- Let's do this! - So Min.

1577
00:54:28.215 --> 00:54:30.150
We'll teach you a lesson.

1578
00:54:30.183 --> 00:54:31.752
(The ace gets ready to fight.)

1579
00:54:31.752 --> 00:54:33.053
We'll definitely win.

1580
00:54:33.053 --> 00:54:36.290
Ji Hyo is tying her hair up. It's over.

1581
00:54:36.723 --> 00:54:38.759
Ji Hyo is tying her hair up. You can't even do that, can you?

1582
00:54:38.759 --> 00:54:40.360
(He's being childish.)

1583
00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:41.361
Ji Hyo...

1584
00:54:41.361 --> 00:54:44.264
"You can't even do that"?

1585
00:54:44.531 --> 00:54:48.168
You don't need to do that. Your hair is too short.

1586
00:54:48.402 --> 00:54:49.903
I'm taller.

1587
00:54:49.903 --> 00:54:51.004
I'm taller than her.

1588
00:54:51.004 --> 00:54:52.839
And my arms are strangely long.

1589
00:54:52.839 --> 00:54:55.075
I think you'll be fine. Your arms are really long.

1590
00:54:55.075 --> 00:54:56.810
They're really long.

1591
00:54:56.810 --> 00:54:58.111
- Finish her. - Like this...

1592
00:54:58.111 --> 00:55:00.013
- and this? - Yes.

1593
00:55:00.013 --> 00:55:01.815
Finish her.

1594
00:55:02.816 --> 00:55:05.252
Stand in the middle with your backs against each other.

1595
00:55:05.252 --> 00:55:07.154
I'm nervous.

1596
00:55:07.154 --> 00:55:08.955
- Let's go. - Be careful.

1597
00:55:08.955 --> 00:55:10.390
- If we win this... - It can go out easily.

1598
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:11.925
- You can do this. - If we win this, it's over.

1599
00:55:11.925 --> 00:55:13.126
We can't lose.

1600
00:55:13.126 --> 00:55:14.661
(Ji Hyo versus So Min)

1601
00:55:14.661 --> 00:55:17.431
So Min, relax. It's okay. There's nothing else you can do.

1602
00:55:17.431 --> 00:55:19.466
- Ji Hyo, relax. - Finish her.

1603
00:55:19.466 --> 00:55:20.600
Ready.

1604
00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:21.702
One.

1605
00:55:21.702 --> 00:55:22.903
(Careful)

1606
00:55:22.903 --> 00:55:24.604
Two.

1607
00:55:25.405 --> 00:55:26.406
Three.

1608
00:55:26.406 --> 00:55:32.446
(Put out the other's candle without putting out your own.)

1609
00:55:32.746 --> 00:55:34.081
(The "fire" game starts.)

1610
00:55:34.081 --> 00:55:35.549
So Min is a coward.

1611
00:55:35.549 --> 00:55:36.950
She is scared of the candle wax dripping.

1612
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:38.585
(He attacks with childish words.)

1613
00:55:38.585 --> 00:55:40.387
So Min, try to put out Ji Hyo's candle.

1614
00:55:41.021 --> 00:55:42.656
Attack. Good.

1615
00:55:42.656 --> 00:55:44.658
Use the plate.

1616
00:55:44.891 --> 00:55:46.293
- Good. - Okay.

1617
00:55:46.293 --> 00:55:47.761
- There you go. - Nice.

1618
00:55:47.761 --> 00:55:48.929
(So Min defends her candle.)

1619
00:55:48.929 --> 00:55:52.332
So Min. Be careful. Move slowly.

1620
00:55:52.332 --> 00:55:55.335
(Her candle almost went out.)

1621
00:55:55.602 --> 00:55:58.305
- What are you doing? - Move your left hand slowly.

1622
00:55:58.305 --> 00:56:01.475
(Ji Hyo counterattacks.)

1623
00:56:01.775 --> 00:56:05.011
(So Min uses her long arms.)

1624
00:56:05.011 --> 00:56:06.646
(But...)

1625
00:56:06.646 --> 00:56:08.382
No. Raise it.

1626
00:56:08.382 --> 00:56:10.183
(So Min's candle flickers again.)

1627
00:56:10.183 --> 00:56:12.085
(She revives her candle...)

1628
00:56:12.085 --> 00:56:14.521
(and counterattacks.)

1629
00:56:14.521 --> 00:56:17.190
(Flickering)

1630
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:18.825
If you move, your candle might go out.

1631
00:56:18.825 --> 00:56:20.360
You're doing well.

1632
00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:22.462
- Good. - Keep going.

1633
00:56:22.462 --> 00:56:24.131
- It's okay. - She can't reach your candle.

1634
00:56:24.131 --> 00:56:25.832
- It's okay. - Attack!

1635
00:56:25.832 --> 00:56:27.634
You have to attack!

1636
00:56:27.634 --> 00:56:30.036
- Stop running away and attack! - Attack!

1637
00:56:30.036 --> 00:56:32.339
You have to attack. Stop running away.

1638
00:56:32.339 --> 00:56:34.441
- You have to attack. - Stop running away.

1639
00:56:34.441 --> 00:56:35.742
(Ji Hyo makes everyone run away.)

1640
00:56:35.742 --> 00:56:37.444
Good.

1641
00:56:37.544 --> 00:56:39.179
Good, Ji Hyo.

1642
00:56:39.179 --> 00:56:41.815
So Min, your candle is higher.

1643
00:56:41.815 --> 00:56:42.816
Yes.

1644
00:56:42.816 --> 00:56:44.151
Her arms are so long. Good.

1645
00:56:44.151 --> 00:56:47.754
(They take quick steps while waiving their plates.)

1646
00:56:47.754 --> 00:56:51.825
(It reminds you of the ballet, "Swan Lake".)

1647
00:56:52.058 --> 00:56:56.029
(Ji Hyo is an elegant and aggressive swan.)

1648
00:56:56.229 --> 00:57:00.333
(So Min is a black swan that escapes from Ji Hyo using her long wings.)

1649
00:57:00.333 --> 00:57:03.703
(It suddenly turns into "Black Swan".)

1650
00:57:03.703 --> 00:57:04.871
So Min has long arms.

1651
00:57:04.871 --> 00:57:06.540
Ji Hyo's arms and legs are short.

1652
00:57:06.673 --> 00:57:08.909
They're about the same height, but Ji Hyo's arms are shorter.

1653
00:57:08.909 --> 00:57:11.545
(Jae Seok attacks his team leader.)

1654
00:57:11.878 --> 00:57:13.346
(Why are you dissing me?)

1655
00:57:13.346 --> 00:57:15.382
- Jae Seok. Why... - It's your chance!

1656
00:57:15.382 --> 00:57:18.151
It's your chance, So Min! Attack!

1657
00:57:18.151 --> 00:57:20.620
Why would you attack your team member?

1658
00:57:21.021 --> 00:57:22.088
Ji Hyo is faltering.

1659
00:57:22.088 --> 00:57:23.924
(Unstable)

1660
00:57:23.924 --> 00:57:25.025
It might go out.

1661
00:57:25.025 --> 00:57:26.693
So Min, don't move too fast.

1662
00:57:26.693 --> 00:57:28.161
- Move slowly. - Ji Hyo.

1663
00:57:28.161 --> 00:57:29.863
(The black swan almost puts out her own candle.)

1664
00:57:29.863 --> 00:57:32.499
As you're about to go to the right, go to the left.

1665
00:57:32.899 --> 00:57:34.901
As you're about to go to the left, go to the right.

1666
00:57:34.901 --> 00:57:37.003
- Hit it with your knee. - Go.

1667
00:57:37.003 --> 00:57:39.906
So Min, be bold and start a physical fight.

1668
00:57:40.006 --> 00:57:41.141
Start a physical fight.

1669
00:57:41.141 --> 00:57:42.742
Ji Hyo, step on her foot.

1670
00:57:42.742 --> 00:57:44.911
- That's good. - You can step on her foot.

1671
00:57:44.911 --> 00:57:46.913
- That's good. - No, don't do that.

1672
00:57:46.913 --> 00:57:48.281
(She's better at running away.)

1673
00:57:48.281 --> 00:57:49.850
No.

1674
00:57:49.850 --> 00:57:53.186
(She runs away from the swan.)

1675
00:57:53.186 --> 00:57:56.389
(She's on her toes without realizing it.)

1676
00:57:56.389 --> 00:57:59.392
- No, don't do that. - Don't run away.

1677
00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:01.928
Don't run away.

1678
00:58:01.928 --> 00:58:05.198
- Just hit her. - I can't do it.

1679
00:58:06.199 --> 00:58:08.935
- Don't run away. - Their hands might hurt.

1680
00:58:08.935 --> 00:58:12.005
(Let's attack for real instead of running away.)

1681
00:58:12.005 --> 00:58:14.941
(Has the black swan started to flap?)

1682
00:58:14.941 --> 00:58:17.110
(Flapping)

1683
00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:18.678
Gosh, that's quite strong.

1684
00:58:18.678 --> 00:58:20.180
(The blow is quite strong.)

1685
00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:22.415
- That's good. - Goodness.

1686
00:58:22.415 --> 00:58:24.084
That's good.

1687
00:58:24.251 --> 00:58:25.352
(They're on their toes.)

1688
00:58:25.352 --> 00:58:27.554
- Hey. - Do it more.

1689
00:58:27.554 --> 00:58:30.123
(Stop running away.)

1690
00:58:30.123 --> 00:58:33.026
So Min's went out.

1691
00:58:33.026 --> 00:58:34.594
(While she was running away,)

1692
00:58:34.594 --> 00:58:36.530
(So Min's candle goes out.)

1693
00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:37.964
(Dignity of the ace of 9 years)

1694
00:58:37.964 --> 00:58:38.965
It went out.

1695
00:58:38.965 --> 00:58:40.734
(Her opponent loses for her.)

1696
00:58:40.734 --> 00:58:42.335
- That's amazing. - It went out as she ran away.

1697
00:58:42.335 --> 00:58:44.070
What's going on with our team?

1698
00:58:44.070 --> 00:58:46.439
- We're a perfect team. - Seriously.

1699
00:58:46.439 --> 00:58:49.175
(Team Champion loses again.)

1700
00:58:49.342 --> 00:58:50.710
We're in trouble.

1701
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:52.879
How could she expose her back?

1702
00:58:52.879 --> 00:58:56.149
Jong Kook is very upset right now.

1703
00:58:56.449 --> 00:58:59.486
- Wait a minute. - Jong Kook is...

1704
00:58:59.486 --> 00:59:01.354
- Okay. - He's angry.

1705
00:59:01.354 --> 00:59:02.989
- Jong Kook. - It's over.

1706
00:59:02.989 --> 00:59:04.124
Good job.

1707
00:59:04.124 --> 00:59:07.060
The winner of the second round is...

1708
00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:08.895
- Team Ace. - Okay.

1709
00:59:08.895 --> 00:59:10.931
It's unbelievable.

1710
00:59:10.931 --> 00:59:12.365
- We won everything. - We keep winning.

1711
00:59:12.365 --> 00:59:15.168
I bet wind would come out if I stretch out my hand.

1712
00:59:15.201 --> 00:59:16.870
We win everything.

1713
00:59:17.070 --> 00:59:19.606
How many slots did the leader of Team Ace bet?

1714
00:59:19.606 --> 00:59:21.942
(Team Ace wins slots for the "fire" game.)

1715
00:59:21.942 --> 00:59:24.311
How many did they bet? That's more important.

1716
00:59:24.311 --> 00:59:26.713
(How many slots did she bet?)

1717
00:59:26.713 --> 00:59:28.081
- It's one slot. - Okay.

1718
00:59:28.081 --> 00:59:30.350
- What about you? - It's one slot.

1719
00:59:30.350 --> 00:59:32.185
- We need to get it back. - We should.

1720
00:59:32.185 --> 00:59:34.220
We have to get it no matter what.

1721
00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:37.223
Keyword for third round is feet.

1722
00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:40.660
- The category is... - Be something we're good at.

1723
00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:42.095
Give us a game that requires strength.

1724
00:59:42.095 --> 00:59:43.730
How about who kicks harder?

1725
00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:46.266
(They're confident about strength.)

1726
00:59:46.266 --> 00:59:47.300
Make it about strength.

1727
00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:49.402
Who can stomp harder?

1728
00:59:49.402 --> 00:59:50.870
- Goodness. - Stomping.

1729
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:52.539
(It can't be a game like that.)

1730
00:59:52.539 --> 00:59:56.109
The game is called Why Can't You Eat?

1731
00:59:56.109 --> 00:59:57.911
(Foot game is Why Can't You Eat.)

1732
00:59:57.911 --> 01:00:00.013
- Do we eat with our feet? - Is it eating?

1733
01:00:00.046 --> 01:00:02.015
- Is it eating? - Do we eat with our feet?

1734
01:00:02.182 --> 01:00:05.552
While sitting, control a hanging piece of bread...

1735
01:00:05.552 --> 01:00:08.788
attached to a string with your toes.

1736
01:00:08.788 --> 01:00:12.058
The team that eats the bread first wins.

1737
01:00:12.058 --> 01:00:15.495
- We definitely can do it. - Goodness.

1738
01:00:16.129 --> 01:00:24.537
(The eldest Seok Jin is the hope of people in their middle age.)

1739
01:00:26.172 --> 01:00:33.546
(Jong kook is the champion who can do everything well.)

1740
01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:36.149
Goodness, okay.

1741
01:00:36.149 --> 01:00:38.518
Let's win everything.

1742
01:00:39.085 --> 01:00:41.321
Hang some chicken breast instead of bread.

1743
01:00:41.321 --> 01:00:42.322
(He asks for a change in food.)

1744
01:00:42.322 --> 01:00:43.890
(Jong Kook doesn't like flour.)

1745
01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:46.026
- Shake. - How about chicken shake?

1746
01:00:46.026 --> 01:00:47.027
Okay.

1747
01:00:47.027 --> 01:00:49.963
Usually Jong Kook and Seok Jin...

1748
01:00:49.963 --> 01:00:52.599
- don't compete with each other. - That's true.

1749
01:00:52.599 --> 01:00:55.101
Get ready.

1750
01:00:55.101 --> 01:00:57.270
(The "foot" game starts.)

1751
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:59.105
He'll eat it.

1752
01:00:59.339 --> 01:01:01.174
(It lands immediately on his tongue.)

1753
01:01:01.174 --> 01:01:02.676
Jong Kook is eating it.

1754
01:01:02.676 --> 01:01:05.512
- Wait a minute, Jong Kook. - Jong Kook is eating it.

1755
01:01:05.512 --> 01:01:07.814
(Pushing)

1756
01:01:08.515 --> 01:01:09.983
He's angry right now.

1757
01:01:09.983 --> 01:01:12.719
(The eldest rookie is at east and cheats.)

1758
01:01:12.719 --> 01:01:14.454
Think of LA.

1759
01:01:14.454 --> 01:01:16.122
It's LA. He's eating it.

1760
01:01:16.122 --> 01:01:18.858
(His appetite increases at the thought of LA.)

1761
01:01:18.858 --> 01:01:20.660
Goodness, he looks scary.

1762
01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:21.961
- Do I eat more? - Does he have to eat all?

1763
01:01:21.961 --> 01:01:23.930
- He has to eat all. - Eat until where the cup is.

1764
01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:25.165
(Based on their performance...)

1765
01:01:25.165 --> 01:01:26.800
Seok Jin, you have to eat it.

1766
01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:29.936
(Only the champion might go to LA.)

1767
01:01:30.370 --> 01:01:32.072
- He only ate the end. - Jong Kook is impressive.

1768
01:01:32.072 --> 01:01:34.741
- Seok Jin. - Seok Jin, you got it.

1769
01:01:34.741 --> 01:01:37.143
(Seok Jin's bread is barely close to his mouth.)

1770
01:01:37.210 --> 01:01:39.145
That's good.

1771
01:01:39.145 --> 01:01:41.514
You got it.

1772
01:01:41.514 --> 01:01:43.216
- You're my role model. - You got it.

1773
01:01:43.416 --> 01:01:45.985
- You got it. - You got it.

1774
01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:48.621
He's melting it with his tongue.

1775
01:01:48.621 --> 01:01:50.790
(It's how the eldest member eats bread.)

1776
01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:52.525
- He soaks it while eating it. - It'll take a long time.

1777
01:01:52.525 --> 01:01:54.060
- It must be sweet. - He soaks it.

1778
01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:55.295
(He melts it with his tongue.)

1779
01:01:55.295 --> 01:01:57.230
Gosh, he finally ate it.

1780
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:59.766
- More and more. - That's not bad.

1781
01:01:59.966 --> 01:02:01.634
He's eating it. He's smart.

1782
01:02:01.634 --> 01:02:03.336
(He's eating at a fast speed.)

1783
01:02:03.336 --> 01:02:04.971
A little bit more.

1784
01:02:04.971 --> 01:02:07.741
Use your foot. Even for Jong Kook,

1785
01:02:07.741 --> 01:02:08.975
it isn't easy.

1786
01:02:08.975 --> 01:02:11.044
It's neck-and-neck.

1787
01:02:11.044 --> 01:02:12.779
That's good.

1788
01:02:12.946 --> 01:02:14.080
(He fails to control it near his face.)

1789
01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.081
That's good.

1790
01:02:15.081 --> 01:02:17.550
(He's good at lifting his leg though.)

1791
01:02:18.551 --> 01:02:20.453
I feel bad for Seok Jin.

1792
01:02:20.453 --> 01:02:25.091
At his age, he'd be a director at a company.

1793
01:02:25.091 --> 01:02:27.861
- He's 54. - 54.

1794
01:02:27.861 --> 01:02:31.331
- 54, 54, 54. - 54, 54, 54.

1795
01:02:31.331 --> 01:02:35.034
(Instead of being a director, he pours his heart to entertainment.)

1796
01:02:35.034 --> 01:02:36.870
A little bit more.

1797
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:40.740
(He makes a veteran's sound.)

1798
01:02:41.141 --> 01:02:42.709
Your nose made a loud sound. Are you okay?

1799
01:02:42.709 --> 01:02:43.777
(What was that sound?)

1800
01:02:43.777 --> 01:02:45.145
(Did he get injured?)

1801
01:02:45.145 --> 01:02:46.946
Jong Kook is laughing too.

1802
01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:49.916
Jong Kook is laughing because it's unbelievable.

1803
01:02:49.916 --> 01:02:52.819
It's a father's challenge.

1804
01:02:52.819 --> 01:02:55.021
(Suddenly, he becomes a father.)

1805
01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:56.623
That's good. You have one chance.

1806
01:02:56.623 --> 01:02:58.324
Pull.

1807
01:02:58.691 --> 01:03:02.095
(Dad, I brought bread. Why can't you eat it?)

1808
01:03:02.095 --> 01:03:03.396
Poor Seok Jin.

1809
01:03:03.396 --> 01:03:04.964
(While Seok Jin can't eat his bread...)

1810
01:03:04.964 --> 01:03:07.433
- He got it. - Goodness.

1811
01:03:07.433 --> 01:03:09.836
(He ate one-third of it.)

1812
01:03:09.836 --> 01:03:12.071
Poor Seok Jin, what do we do?

1813
01:03:12.071 --> 01:03:13.640
He got it. Okay.

1814
01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:14.941
A little more.

1815
01:03:14.941 --> 01:03:17.110
(He takes a big bite.)

1816
01:03:17.143 --> 01:03:19.112
(Jong Kook has one bite left.)

1817
01:03:19.112 --> 01:03:20.146
You're done after one more bite.

1818
01:03:20.146 --> 01:03:22.215
- He's almost done. - Come on.

1819
01:03:22.215 --> 01:03:23.883
Just eat it in one go.

1820
01:03:23.883 --> 01:03:26.186
Do you think it's possible?

1821
01:03:26.186 --> 01:03:27.954
(Kicking)

1822
01:03:27.954 --> 01:03:30.356
My role model kicked me.

1823
01:03:30.356 --> 01:03:31.991
(Is that how he is?)

1824
01:03:31.991 --> 01:03:33.426
(Focus on eating.)

1825
01:03:33.426 --> 01:03:34.661
Okay.

1826
01:03:34.661 --> 01:03:37.263
(I'm working on it.)

1827
01:03:37.931 --> 01:03:39.232
Come on. That's it.

1828
01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:40.834
My role model is cheating.

1829
01:03:40.834 --> 01:03:44.437
(His love for Seok Jin is destroyed.)

1830
01:03:45.271 --> 01:03:47.207
- Be quiet. - Be quiet.

1831
01:03:47.207 --> 01:03:49.175
Be quiet, Haha.

1832
01:03:49.175 --> 01:03:50.877
Just be quiet.

1833
01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:54.614
It's because my leg is too long.

1834
01:03:55.481 --> 01:03:56.950
(Shall we cheat a little too?)

1835
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:58.451
Why doesn't it work when it worked before?

1836
01:03:58.451 --> 01:04:00.386
It should come down.

1837
01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:03.823
- It worked before. - It passed.

1838
01:04:03.823 --> 01:04:05.758
(Slapping)

1839
01:04:06.025 --> 01:04:09.095
(He catches their cheating.)

1840
01:04:09.095 --> 01:04:11.331
It's our team's business.

1841
01:04:11.331 --> 01:04:14.434
You pushed it in too much.

1842
01:04:14.434 --> 01:04:17.237
- I'm sorry. I didn't know. - What are you doing?

1843
01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:19.973
- It's right here. - Yes, it's right there.

1844
01:04:19.973 --> 01:04:22.642
(Ji Hyo is about to feed Seok Jin.)

1845
01:04:22.642 --> 01:04:24.410
- Eat it. - Goodness.

1846
01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:26.012
I got it.

1847
01:04:26.012 --> 01:04:27.480
A little bit closer.

1848
01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:28.815
(Jong Kook's bread descends vertically.)

1849
01:04:28.815 --> 01:04:30.149
It came down.

1850
01:04:30.149 --> 01:04:31.551
(He takes his last bite with all his might.)

1851
01:04:31.551 --> 01:04:33.486
- It's coming. - Come on.

1852
01:04:33.486 --> 01:04:34.654
Okay.

1853
01:04:34.654 --> 01:04:37.757
- Eat the long piece. - Suck it in.

1854
01:04:37.991 --> 01:04:40.360
(Chew it quickly.)

1855
01:04:40.593 --> 01:04:43.162
(Pull it, Team Leader.)

1856
01:04:43.162 --> 01:04:44.631
(At that time)

1857
01:04:44.631 --> 01:04:47.200
(Jong Kook tears it.)

1858
01:04:47.333 --> 01:04:49.068
(The champion wins.)

1859
01:04:49.068 --> 01:04:51.070
Okay!

1860
01:04:51.070 --> 01:04:52.472
You got it.

1861
01:04:52.472 --> 01:04:54.240
- You're sweating. - Jong Kook.

1862
01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.842
(We'll take you home.)

1863
01:04:55.842 --> 01:04:57.043
Good job.

1864
01:04:57.043 --> 01:04:59.245
(My leg hurts.)

1865
01:04:59.245 --> 01:05:00.346
(Massaging)

1866
01:05:00.346 --> 01:05:02.215
- My goodness. - That's impressive.

1867
01:05:02.215 --> 01:05:04.183
It didn't come off.

1868
01:05:04.183 --> 01:05:06.452
I didn't know Jong Kook liked bread so much.

1869
01:05:06.452 --> 01:05:07.654
(He gets annoying.)

1870
01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:10.623
(He forces a new palate on him.)

1871
01:05:10.623 --> 01:05:12.859
Jong Kook is enjoying the bread.

1872
01:05:12.859 --> 01:05:14.661
Why did you eat chicken breast until now?

1873
01:05:14.661 --> 01:05:16.796
(You turned into a lover of bread.)

1874
01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:19.299
(Despite Seok Jin's efforts, the champion wins.)

1875
01:05:19.299 --> 01:05:21.501
The winner of the third round is...

1876
01:05:21.501 --> 01:05:22.702
Team Champion.

1877
01:05:22.702 --> 01:05:23.703
Okay.

1878
01:05:23.703 --> 01:05:26.272
(It's the first win for Team Champion.)

1879
01:05:26.272 --> 01:05:27.573
They didn't bet four, did they?

1880
01:05:27.573 --> 01:05:29.042
That's impossible.

1881
01:05:29.042 --> 01:05:32.812
How many roulette slots did Jong Kook bet?

1882
01:05:32.812 --> 01:05:36.149
(How many slots will Team Champion gain?)

1883
01:05:36.149 --> 01:05:37.183
It's two slots.

1884
01:05:37.183 --> 01:05:39.152
(Team Champion wins 2 slots.)

1885
01:05:39.152 --> 01:05:41.554
(We're still way ahead.)

1886
01:05:41.554 --> 01:05:42.855
- They did well. - So Min.

1887
01:05:42.855 --> 01:05:44.590
The current total is...

1888
01:05:44.590 --> 01:05:48.394
Team Ace has 9 slots. Team Champion has 3 slots.

1889
01:05:48.394 --> 01:05:49.762
They're not even close.

1890
01:05:49.762 --> 01:05:51.631
Why do they have so little?

1891
01:05:51.631 --> 01:05:54.500
- It's okay. - Next is the last round.

1892
01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:55.735
- Let's go. - We can do it.

1893
01:05:55.735 --> 01:05:57.570
I'll bet my life.

1894
01:05:57.570 --> 01:05:59.539
(Who will be the winner?)

1895
01:05:59.973 --> 01:06:00.974
It's the last round.

1896
01:06:00.974 --> 01:06:03.443
Okay, it's the last. If we win this round,

1897
01:06:03.443 --> 01:06:05.712
we'll be one step closer to LA.

1898
01:06:05.712 --> 01:06:08.448
- That's true. - It's getting better.

1899
01:06:08.781 --> 01:06:11.451
Ace versus the Champion, La La Land Race.

1900
01:06:11.451 --> 01:06:14.020
It's the last round for a trip to LA as a prize.

1901
01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:15.822
Trust Me Half Way.

1902
01:06:15.822 --> 01:06:19.025
(Trust Me Half Way)

1903
01:06:19.292 --> 01:06:21.494
(Ace versus the Champion, Round 3)

1904
01:06:21.494 --> 01:06:24.130
Within the limited time, cut the given ingredient...

1905
01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:26.065
exactly in half.

1906
01:06:26.065 --> 01:06:28.701
The person who is more accurate wins.

1907
01:06:28.701 --> 01:06:32.305
You win two points if you cut it exactly in half.

1908
01:06:32.372 --> 01:06:33.973
Two points?

1909
01:06:34.574 --> 01:06:36.075
- Cut it exactly? - Really?

1910
01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:39.112
It's important to estimate well.

1911
01:06:39.112 --> 01:06:40.980
Everyone, this game is...

1912
01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:43.449
currently very popular abroad.

1913
01:06:43.449 --> 01:06:45.752
- It's popular. - Many people play this?

1914
01:06:45.752 --> 01:06:48.521
- Okay. - We must win insider game too.

1915
01:06:48.521 --> 01:06:50.656
For the first round,

1916
01:06:50.656 --> 01:06:53.593
pick a player from your team.

1917
01:06:53.593 --> 01:06:55.061
Who shall play first?

1918
01:06:55.061 --> 01:06:56.462
- Shall I go first? - Yes, go, Se Chan.

1919
01:06:56.462 --> 01:06:57.630
I'll start.

1920
01:06:57.630 --> 01:06:58.631
- How about Seok Jin? - I'll go.

1921
01:06:58.631 --> 01:06:59.999
Okay.

1922
01:06:59.999 --> 01:07:03.336
First round is Seok Jin versus Se Chan.

1923
01:07:03.336 --> 01:07:04.971
Here's the first ingredient.

1924
01:07:04.971 --> 01:07:07.306
Please bring the ingredient.

1925
01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:08.641
What could it be?

1926
01:07:08.641 --> 01:07:09.609
What's that?

1927
01:07:09.609 --> 01:07:11.344
(Surprised)

1928
01:07:11.344 --> 01:07:14.747
- They're eggplant. - That's good.

1929
01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:18.184
- The top and bottom are different. - Right.

1930
01:07:18.184 --> 01:07:20.319
I need to find the center of gravity.

1931
01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:23.823
Look how scientific Seok Jin is.

1932
01:07:23.823 --> 01:07:26.926
You have one minute from now.

1933
01:07:26.926 --> 01:07:30.329
Put the halves on the scales in one minute.

1934
01:07:30.329 --> 01:07:31.964
Get ready.

1935
01:07:32.165 --> 01:07:33.966
Start.

1936
01:07:38.471 --> 01:07:42.442
(They both try to find the center of gravity.)

1937
01:07:42.442 --> 01:07:44.811
(Weighing)

1938
01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:47.480
(At that time)

1939
01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.715
This is it, but the left side is a bit heavier.

1940
01:07:49.715 --> 01:07:51.250
Seok Jin put it on his finger.

1941
01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:53.152
Seok Jin found the center.

1942
01:07:53.152 --> 01:07:55.655
He's like someone at KAIST.

1943
01:07:55.822 --> 01:07:57.490
Someone at NASA.

1944
01:07:58.191 --> 01:07:59.625
(Why can't I find the center of gravity?)

1945
01:07:59.625 --> 01:08:01.494
I'll try to guess.

1946
01:08:02.728 --> 01:08:05.164
- Here he goes. - Here he goes.

1947
01:08:05.231 --> 01:08:07.567
(I got it.)

1948
01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:08.835
You have 10 seconds left.

1949
01:08:08.835 --> 01:08:10.670
- 10 seconds. - 9.

1950
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:11.904
- 8. - 8.

1951
01:08:11.904 --> 01:08:14.540
(Se Chan starts to cut as well.)

1952
01:08:14.841 --> 01:08:16.542
(Let's go, Seok Jin. Let's go, Se Chan.)

1953
01:08:16.542 --> 01:08:17.543
- 3. - 3.

1954
01:08:17.543 --> 01:08:19.545
(Careful)

1955
01:08:19.545 --> 01:08:23.749
(Seok Jin cuts confidently while Se Chan cuts carefully.)

1956
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:26.219
Okay, you'll put it up 1 by 1.

1957
01:08:27.553 --> 01:08:28.921
Why did you cut it slanted?

1958
01:08:28.921 --> 01:08:32.125
(Wait a minute, why did you cut it slanted?)

1959
01:08:32.125 --> 01:08:33.759
That one is very slanted.

1960
01:08:33.759 --> 01:08:36.062
- Did you slice it diagonally? - Wait.

1961
01:08:36.062 --> 01:08:38.931
Why did you cut it slanted?

1962
01:08:38.931 --> 01:08:41.167
At least he didn't cut his finger.

1963
01:08:42.034 --> 01:08:44.570
It's very slanted.

1964
01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:46.873
Seok Jin will put them on the scales.

1965
01:08:46.873 --> 01:08:48.941
- Put them 1 by 1. - This one is heavier.

1966
01:08:48.941 --> 01:08:50.543
(Seok Jin's first eggplant's weight)

1967
01:08:50.543 --> 01:08:51.611
1 by 1.

1968
01:08:51.611 --> 01:08:53.112
It's exactly 70g.

1969
01:08:53.112 --> 01:08:54.747
Okay.

1970
01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:57.016
We don't know yet.

1971
01:08:57.016 --> 01:08:58.184
- We don't know. - Here I go.

1972
01:08:58.184 --> 01:08:59.252
I'll do this one.

1973
01:08:59.252 --> 01:09:01.754
(Se Chan's first eggplant's weight)

1974
01:09:01.754 --> 01:09:03.456
It's 66g.

1975
01:09:03.456 --> 01:09:04.924
That sounds good.

1976
01:09:04.924 --> 01:09:06.926
The sizes are similar. It's good.

1977
01:09:06.926 --> 01:09:09.629
- It'd be amazing if it's 70g. - That'd be amazing.

1978
01:09:09.629 --> 01:09:11.430
Let's see.

1979
01:09:11.664 --> 01:09:12.698
Let's see.

1980
01:09:12.698 --> 01:09:15.334
(How much does Seok Jin's second eggplant weigh?)

1981
01:09:15.334 --> 01:09:19.172
(The closer it is to 70g, he has a higher chance of winning.)

1982
01:09:19.172 --> 01:09:20.873
Let's see.

1983
01:09:21.541 --> 01:09:22.708
It's 60g.

1984
01:09:22.708 --> 01:09:24.477
The difference is 10g.

1985
01:09:25.044 --> 01:09:28.214
(Is the result 10g?)

1986
01:09:28.614 --> 01:09:30.416
- Why? - We don't know yet.

1987
01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:31.551
66g sounds good.

1988
01:09:31.551 --> 01:09:33.853
(Seok Jin's result is disappointing.)

1989
01:09:33.853 --> 01:09:34.854
I'll put it on.

1990
01:09:34.854 --> 01:09:37.290
(How much does Se Chan's second eggplant weigh?)

1991
01:09:37.290 --> 01:09:43.829
(If the difference is less than 10g, Se Chan wins.)

1992
01:09:45.231 --> 01:09:47.900
(Se Chan's difference is 2g.)

1993
01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:49.368
- Okay. - That was good.

1994
01:09:49.368 --> 01:09:51.270
(Is the difference really 2g?)

1995
01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:53.706
- Okay, it's 2g. - My goodness.

1996
01:09:53.706 --> 01:09:55.274
(Se Chan wins.)

1997
01:09:55.274 --> 01:09:56.509
- Did I do well? - You did.

1998
01:09:56.509 --> 01:09:58.344
- Tell me. - Good job.

1999
01:09:58.344 --> 01:10:00.580
(He cut it so well.)

2000
01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:02.982
- Se Chan wins the first round. - Okay.

2001
01:10:02.982 --> 01:10:05.651
- Okay. - I didn't have high expectations.

2002
01:10:05.651 --> 01:10:07.420
Our team is coming back.

2003
01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:09.589
- Scores tie if we win one more. - Who's next?

2004
01:10:09.922 --> 01:10:10.990
So Min or Kwang Soo?

2005
01:10:10.990 --> 01:10:12.592
- I'll go. - Okay, So Min.

2006
01:10:12.592 --> 01:10:14.660
- Who's next? - I'll go.

2007
01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:15.661
Haha.

2008
01:10:15.661 --> 01:10:17.763
- Cut it slowly. - I'm too anxious.

2009
01:10:17.763 --> 01:10:19.732
- That was so close. - Do it, Haha.

2010
01:10:19.732 --> 01:10:22.635
- It's Haha. - You're in the restaurant business.

2011
01:10:23.202 --> 01:10:25.404
However, I don't go in the kitchen.

2012
01:10:25.404 --> 01:10:27.340
Here's the second ingredient.

2013
01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:28.841
I hope it's an easy one.

2014
01:10:28.841 --> 01:10:30.243
That one is...

2015
01:10:30.243 --> 01:10:32.011
- What is it? - What?

2016
01:10:32.011 --> 01:10:33.980
What is it? Is it gimbap?

2017
01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:35.581
This one is difficult.

2018
01:10:35.581 --> 01:10:37.750
- Goodness. - The inside is protruding.

2019
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:41.153
It's important where the rice is.

2020
01:10:41.153 --> 01:10:44.290
The timer will start. You have one minute.

2021
01:10:44.824 --> 01:10:46.792
It's nothing, but it's not easy.

2022
01:10:46.792 --> 01:10:49.295
- It makes us focused. - I'm nervous.

2023
01:10:49.395 --> 01:10:51.063
Trust your feeling.

2024
01:10:51.163 --> 01:10:54.400
- I went to many gimbap restaurants. - That's good.

2025
01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.369
I'm nervous.

2026
01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:57.970
This is interesting.

2027
01:10:57.970 --> 01:11:00.273
Try to feel the weight with the finger.

2028
01:11:00.273 --> 01:11:01.340
Adjust it.

2029
01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.876
If you squeeze it more, gimbap might burst.

2030
01:11:04.043 --> 01:11:05.611
- You'll be in trouble. - Right.

2031
01:11:05.611 --> 01:11:07.780
All right. 10, 9.

2032
01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:09.015
You have to decide.

2033
01:11:09.015 --> 01:11:10.149
- Decide, Haha. - Eight.

2034
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:12.685
(Haha takes the knife.)

2035
01:11:12.918 --> 01:11:14.720
- Do it slowly. - Take your time.

2036
01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:16.322
(I'll show you what it means to work in the restaurant business.)

2037
01:11:16.322 --> 01:11:18.324
- I think this is it. - It is.

2038
01:11:18.324 --> 01:11:20.793
- You have to cut it carefully. - Cut it well.

2039
01:11:20.793 --> 01:11:23.195
- Cut it straight. - Cut it carefully.

2040
01:11:23.195 --> 01:11:25.131
- That's right. - Right.

2041
01:11:25.131 --> 01:11:26.832
- You got it. - It's neat.

2042
01:11:26.832 --> 01:11:28.601
That's right.

2043
01:11:28.601 --> 01:11:30.469
- You got it. - That was great.

2044
01:11:30.469 --> 01:11:31.671
You got it, So Min.

2045
01:11:31.671 --> 01:11:32.838
That's right.

2046
01:11:32.838 --> 01:11:34.974
(Slicing)

2047
01:11:34.974 --> 01:11:35.975
It's done.

2048
01:11:35.975 --> 01:11:38.144
(Haha shows his meticulous cutting.)

2049
01:11:38.144 --> 01:11:40.313
Let's start with Haha.

2050
01:11:40.313 --> 01:11:41.781
Put it on the scale.

2051
01:11:41.781 --> 01:11:43.649
- This is... - Right?

2052
01:11:43.783 --> 01:11:45.051
You did a good job.

2053
01:11:45.051 --> 01:11:47.320
(Haha's first gimbap's weight)

2054
01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:49.455
- 144g. - 144g.

2055
01:11:51.023 --> 01:11:52.792
- This looks heavier. - It's okay.

2056
01:11:52.792 --> 01:11:54.860
This one looks heavier too.

2057
01:11:55.061 --> 01:11:56.329
It just seems that way.

2058
01:11:56.329 --> 01:11:57.396
(So Min's first gimbap's weight)

2059
01:11:57.396 --> 01:11:59.265
Why are there two grains of rice?

2060
01:11:59.332 --> 01:12:00.633
134g.

2061
01:12:00.633 --> 01:12:01.901
- It's okay. - His was 144g.

2062
01:12:01.901 --> 01:12:05.204
- Both gimbap don't weigh the same. - No.

2063
01:12:05.204 --> 01:12:06.839
Weigh the other one.

2064
01:12:07.273 --> 01:12:10.276
(It's time to weigh the second piece.)

2065
01:12:10.276 --> 01:12:12.311
(Will the 2nd one weigh close to 144g?)

2066
01:12:12.311 --> 01:12:13.646
You're in the restaurant business.

2067
01:12:13.646 --> 01:12:16.982
(With Haha's senses)

2068
01:12:17.116 --> 01:12:18.250
- It's 136g. - 136g.

2069
01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:19.785
(Haha's difference is 8g.)

2070
01:12:19.785 --> 01:12:20.853
It's 136g.

2071
01:12:20.853 --> 01:12:22.788
(8g is a little risky.)

2072
01:12:22.788 --> 01:12:26.125
This is difficult. It's hard.

2073
01:12:26.125 --> 01:12:27.993
- Is it me? - It should be in 130s.

2074
01:12:27.993 --> 01:12:29.929
If it's 8g, we have a chance to win.

2075
01:12:29.929 --> 01:12:32.631
(How much does So Min's second gimbap weigh?)

2076
01:12:32.631 --> 01:12:33.733
Here we go, So Min.

2077
01:12:33.733 --> 01:12:34.834
You got it.

2078
01:12:34.834 --> 01:12:41.340
(So Min wins if the difference is less than 8g.)

2079
01:12:42.942 --> 01:12:45.511
- It's 136g. - It's 2g.

2080
01:12:45.511 --> 01:12:47.880
(The difference is 2g again.)

2081
01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:49.482
- The difference keeps being 2g. - 2g.

2082
01:12:49.482 --> 01:12:50.750
(So Min wins.)

2083
01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:53.285
- My goodness. - Why are they so good?

2084
01:12:53.452 --> 01:12:55.121
Okay, I'll go this time.

2085
01:12:55.121 --> 01:12:56.722
- Jae Seok? - I'll do it, Ji Hyo.

2086
01:12:56.722 --> 01:12:57.790
If you lose, it's over.

2087
01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:58.991
(If Team Ace loses again, they lose Round 3.)

2088
01:12:58.991 --> 01:13:00.326
- Kwang Soo. - That's right.

2089
01:13:00.326 --> 01:13:03.863
- Let's keep going. - Kwang Soo is good at it.

2090
01:13:04.230 --> 01:13:05.431
It isn't easy.

2091
01:13:05.431 --> 01:13:08.434
(Stop right there, Team Champion. Here comes the game expert.)

2092
01:13:08.434 --> 01:13:10.069
Sir.

2093
01:13:10.436 --> 01:13:13.038
(It's a war of nerves.)

2094
01:13:13.038 --> 01:13:14.306
He's a troublemaker.

2095
01:13:14.306 --> 01:13:15.875
Don't stab each other.

2096
01:13:15.875 --> 01:13:18.344
Here's the third ingredient.

2097
01:13:18.411 --> 01:13:19.879
- This one is difficult. - It's difficult.

2098
01:13:19.879 --> 01:13:22.281
- Here's the third ingredient. - This one is difficult.

2099
01:13:22.281 --> 01:13:23.949
It's difficult.

2100
01:13:24.083 --> 01:13:25.785
Goodness.

2101
01:13:25.951 --> 01:13:27.253
This one is too difficult.

2102
01:13:27.253 --> 01:13:28.921
Come on.

2103
01:13:28.921 --> 01:13:32.825
- It has a strange shape. - The shape isn't smooth.

2104
01:13:33.092 --> 01:13:34.660
It's cabbage.

2105
01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:36.262
It's difficult.

2106
01:13:36.262 --> 01:13:38.063
This one is too difficult.

2107
01:13:38.063 --> 01:13:39.265
How is it possible?

2108
01:13:39.265 --> 01:13:41.434
If your cut is slanted...

2109
01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:43.602
Do I have to cut it once with a knife?

2110
01:13:43.602 --> 01:13:44.770
Yes.

2111
01:13:44.770 --> 01:13:45.871
All right.

2112
01:13:45.871 --> 01:13:48.240
One minute on the clock starts now.

2113
01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:49.875
It's too difficult.

2114
01:13:49.875 --> 01:13:51.010
How do I do it?

2115
01:13:51.010 --> 01:13:52.411
- Is there a method? - It's difficult.

2116
01:13:52.411 --> 01:13:54.246
I can't find the middle either.

2117
01:13:54.246 --> 01:13:55.381
The shape is not even.

2118
01:13:55.381 --> 01:13:56.916
My goodness.

2119
01:13:56.916 --> 01:13:59.218
It's hard to find the center.

2120
01:13:59.785 --> 01:14:01.821
Shall I apply the Pythagorean theorem?

2121
01:14:01.821 --> 01:14:05.391
(Is he that educated?)

2122
01:14:05.391 --> 01:14:07.760
I'll use Newton's Laws.

2123
01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:09.061
"Newton's Laws"?

2124
01:14:09.061 --> 01:14:11.030
You should apply Murphy's law.

2125
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:12.865
"Murphy's law"?

2126
01:14:12.865 --> 01:14:14.600
- It's confusing. - Isn't it protruding this way?

2127
01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:16.135
How about here?

2128
01:14:16.135 --> 01:14:17.269
There's no way.

2129
01:14:17.269 --> 01:14:19.171
Don't talk to him. Just trust your feeling.

2130
01:14:19.171 --> 01:14:21.307
Trust your feeling, Jae Seok.

2131
01:14:22.141 --> 01:14:23.375
(Kwang Soo searches with Newton's Laws.)

2132
01:14:23.375 --> 01:14:25.110
If you pin it, it will balance.

2133
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:26.679
Wait.

2134
01:14:26.679 --> 01:14:29.081
- Don't make marks with the knife. - Don't do that.

2135
01:14:29.081 --> 01:14:30.282
Kwang Soo.

2136
01:14:30.282 --> 01:14:31.984
Don't make marks with the knife.

2137
01:14:31.984 --> 01:14:33.886
- Kwang Soo. - He cut it.

2138
01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:35.354
- He cut it. - What are you doing?

2139
01:14:35.354 --> 01:14:37.089
- You have to cut it right there. - Kwang Soo.

2140
01:14:37.089 --> 01:14:38.324
(What?)

2141
01:14:38.324 --> 01:14:40.459
What are you doing?

2142
01:14:40.759 --> 01:14:42.461
- Kwang Soo. - 10 seconds?

2143
01:14:42.461 --> 01:14:43.529
(It's time to cut it.)

2144
01:14:43.529 --> 01:14:46.031
- I'll slice it. - It's based on luck.

2145
01:14:46.031 --> 01:14:47.166
Cut well in the middle.

2146
01:14:47.166 --> 01:14:50.236
The one who cuts it well will win. Watch out.

2147
01:14:50.236 --> 01:14:51.570
It's too slanted.

2148
01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:54.673
You should cut it a little slanted.

2149
01:14:54.773 --> 01:14:56.509
- He cut it. - It's already done.

2150
01:14:56.509 --> 01:14:57.843
(There's no turning back.)

2151
01:14:57.843 --> 01:15:00.346
- Turn to the left. - To the left.

2152
01:15:00.346 --> 01:15:02.748
- To the left. - Yes, cut straight.

2153
01:15:02.982 --> 01:15:04.049
Just cut it.

2154
01:15:04.049 --> 01:15:06.252
- Okay, I got it. - He cut it well.

2155
01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:07.453
Everyone.

2156
01:15:07.453 --> 01:15:09.755
- Jae Seok, put it on first. - Goodness.

2157
01:15:09.755 --> 01:15:10.990
It's done.

2158
01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:13.192
- They weigh about the same. - Some fell off.

2159
01:15:13.192 --> 01:15:15.294
(Wait, some fell off.)

2160
01:15:15.494 --> 01:15:16.662
Put them on here.

2161
01:15:16.662 --> 01:15:18.430
They fell off.

2162
01:15:18.831 --> 01:15:20.032
Are you ready?

2163
01:15:20.032 --> 01:15:21.433
They weigh about the same.

2164
01:15:21.433 --> 01:15:23.135
If we lose, is it over?

2165
01:15:23.302 --> 01:15:26.171
If they weigh the same, you get two points.

2166
01:15:26.171 --> 01:15:28.073
- Put it on, Jae Seok. - Gosh.

2167
01:15:28.073 --> 01:15:30.009
(Will Jae Seok save his team?)

2168
01:15:30.009 --> 01:15:33.178
(Jae Seok's first cabbage's weight)

2169
01:15:33.178 --> 01:15:35.314
- It's 1,192g. - 1,192g.

2170
01:15:35.314 --> 01:15:36.949
Does it weigh 1kg?

2171
01:15:36.949 --> 01:15:38.384
All right, Kwang Soo.

2172
01:15:38.384 --> 01:15:39.985
Put it on, Kwang Soo.

2173
01:15:39.985 --> 01:15:43.289
(Kwang Soo's first cabbage's weight)

2174
01:15:43.289 --> 01:15:45.824
It's 1,278g. Jae Seok?

2175
01:15:45.824 --> 01:15:48.260
It's okay. We don't know who won.

2176
01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:49.395
(No one knows who the winner is.)

2177
01:15:49.395 --> 01:15:52.131
(They weigh the first piece of cabbage.)

2178
01:15:52.131 --> 01:15:53.999
If you think they're similar, you're right.

2179
01:15:54.199 --> 01:15:57.703
(The problem is the weight of the second piece.)

2180
01:15:57.703 --> 01:16:01.674
(How much does Jae Seok's second cabbage weigh?)

2181
01:16:01.674 --> 01:16:05.578
(The closer it is to 1,192g, he has a higher chance of winning.)

2182
01:16:05.811 --> 01:16:08.113
It's 1,254g. You did well.

2183
01:16:08.113 --> 01:16:09.114
It's not bad.

2184
01:16:09.114 --> 01:16:11.350
- You did well. - It's not bad.

2185
01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:12.785
It isn't bad, right?

2186
01:16:12.785 --> 01:16:14.853
- It's 62g. - The difference is 62g.

2187
01:16:14.853 --> 01:16:17.356
- Ours will be... - Kwang Soo's was 1,278g.

2188
01:16:17.356 --> 01:16:18.924
- It's a bit heavier. - I think so.

2189
01:16:18.924 --> 01:16:22.061
(If the difference is less than 62g, Team Champion wins.)

2190
01:16:22.061 --> 01:16:24.930
(Will Kwang Soo lead his team to victory?)

2191
01:16:24.930 --> 01:16:28.534
(Let's see how Team Champion does.)

2192
01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:32.771
- What? - What is it?

2193
01:16:32.771 --> 01:16:34.673
(Kwang Soo's difference is 68g.)

2194
01:16:34.673 --> 01:16:36.241
(Did we lose?)

2195
01:16:36.241 --> 01:16:37.843
- What's the difference? - 6g.

2196
01:16:37.843 --> 01:16:38.844
Did we win?

2197
01:16:38.844 --> 01:16:40.746
- We won. - Jae Seok won.

2198
01:16:40.746 --> 01:16:42.915
Okay, okay.

2199
01:16:42.915 --> 01:16:44.683
- Okay. - Good job.

2200
01:16:44.683 --> 01:16:46.352
It was difficult.

2201
01:16:46.352 --> 01:16:47.519
This saved us.

2202
01:16:47.519 --> 01:16:49.388
It was difficult.

2203
01:16:49.655 --> 01:16:51.123
- It's okay. - You did well.

2204
01:16:51.123 --> 01:16:53.826
- It couldn't be helped. - Good job.

2205
01:16:53.959 --> 01:16:55.461
If Ji Hyo wins, we go to the final round.

2206
01:16:55.461 --> 01:16:56.729
- Ji Hyo. - Let's go.

2207
01:16:56.729 --> 01:16:59.131
(Only two players remain.)

2208
01:16:59.131 --> 01:17:01.000
- It's a match between team leaders. - Yes.

2209
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.835
- All right. - Let's go.

2210
01:17:02.835 --> 01:17:05.371
- Let's go. - If Jong Kook wins, game is over.

2211
01:17:05.371 --> 01:17:06.939
If Ji Hyo wins, we go to Round Five.

2212
01:17:06.939 --> 01:17:08.641
- Let's go, Ji Hyo. - Let's go.

2213
01:17:08.641 --> 01:17:09.808
Let's go to LA.

2214
01:17:09.808 --> 01:17:11.644
(What will be their ingredient?)

2215
01:17:11.644 --> 01:17:13.512
Next ingredient is...

2216
01:17:13.512 --> 01:17:14.546
eggs.

2217
01:17:14.546 --> 01:17:16.382
- Eggs? - Boiled eggs?

2218
01:17:16.382 --> 01:17:17.616
This one is difficult.

2219
01:17:17.616 --> 01:17:19.284
It's cooked.

2220
01:17:19.284 --> 01:17:21.153
(The ingredient is fragile.)

2221
01:17:21.153 --> 01:17:23.355
- How is it possible? - It's cooked.

2222
01:17:23.489 --> 01:17:25.424
It's dented.

2223
01:17:25.624 --> 01:17:27.292
(Key is that it's dented.)

2224
01:17:27.292 --> 01:17:29.762
How can you cut this in half?

2225
01:17:29.762 --> 01:17:31.630
Jong Kook has touched them countless times.

2226
01:17:31.630 --> 01:17:32.631
- Jong Kook. - But...

2227
01:17:32.631 --> 01:17:33.866
- You must have an idea. - This is a different matter.

2228
01:17:33.866 --> 01:17:36.335
It's a matter of figuring out...

2229
01:17:36.335 --> 01:17:37.369
- where the yolk leans. - That's right.

2230
01:17:37.369 --> 01:17:38.671
- Yes. - She is right.

2231
01:17:38.671 --> 01:17:41.540
The yolk could lean heavily to one side.

2232
01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:43.108
Ji Hyo, feel it lightly.

2233
01:17:43.108 --> 01:17:45.744
- Think about the shape. - You have a minute.

2234
01:17:46.111 --> 01:17:49.014
(The last round starts.)

2235
01:17:49.815 --> 01:17:52.251
Staring at it won't help you.

2236
01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:54.353
- She took the knife right away. - You can't go back once it's in.

2237
01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:56.822
Ji Hyo, go with your gut feeling.

2238
01:17:56.822 --> 01:17:58.190
There is no other way.

2239
01:17:58.190 --> 01:17:59.625
(Ji Hyo moves in with a knife.)

2240
01:17:59.625 --> 01:18:01.493
This is really hard.

2241
01:18:01.493 --> 01:18:02.761
Eggs are hard.

2242
01:18:02.761 --> 01:18:04.963
You can't make it stand.

2243
01:18:04.963 --> 01:18:07.766
(It's tricky.)

2244
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.535
Move it a bit to the left.

2245
01:18:09.535 --> 01:18:11.203
- Ji Hyo is cutting it. - Is she cutting it already?

2246
01:18:11.203 --> 01:18:13.806
(At that moment)

2247
01:18:13.806 --> 01:18:15.140
- She is cutting it. - I can see the yolk.

2248
01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:17.776
- She is cutting it. - The left side seems a bit bigger.

2249
01:18:17.776 --> 01:18:19.311
Forget it. It's over.

2250
01:18:19.311 --> 01:18:20.612
- Go with it. - Which side has more yolk?

2251
01:18:20.612 --> 01:18:22.214
She cut it nearly in half.

2252
01:18:22.214 --> 01:18:23.916
I think she cut it nearly in half.

2253
01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:25.751
Ji Hyo cut it really well.

2254
01:18:25.751 --> 01:18:26.752
All right.

2255
01:18:26.752 --> 01:18:28.320
(Jong Kook was using the original tactics.)

2256
01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:29.722
- Jong Kook, the yolk... - I lost some of it.

2257
01:18:29.722 --> 01:18:30.856
It shouldn't be sticking out.

2258
01:18:30.856 --> 01:18:31.890
It lost some of it.

2259
01:18:31.890 --> 01:18:33.692
Why is there so much yolk on the knife?

2260
01:18:33.692 --> 01:18:36.628
(Why is there so much yolk on the knife?)

2261
01:18:36.628 --> 01:18:38.130
- What is this? - You got this.

2262
01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:39.131
- Gosh. - Let's go.

2263
01:18:39.131 --> 01:18:41.800
- Ji Hyo, put a piece on the scale. - We won.

2264
01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:43.635
- I think we lost. - Put a piece on the scale.

2265
01:18:43.635 --> 01:18:45.270
We won.

2266
01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:46.972
(What's the weight of the 1st half of Ji Hyo's egg?)

2267
01:18:46.972 --> 01:18:48.574
My goodness.

2268
01:18:48.574 --> 01:18:49.675
Put a piece on the scale.

2269
01:18:49.675 --> 01:18:51.076
(Ji Hyo's first egg’s weight)

2270
01:18:51.076 --> 01:18:52.845
18g.

2271
01:18:53.345 --> 01:18:55.180
- 18g. - I think we lost.

2272
01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:56.715
- I think we lost. - Ji Hyo.

2273
01:18:56.715 --> 01:18:57.916
We will put one on a scale.

2274
01:18:57.916 --> 01:18:59.618
Go ahead.

2275
01:19:00.552 --> 01:19:01.620
I think this one is heavy.

2276
01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:03.856
(Jong Kook’s first egg’s weight)

2277
01:19:03.856 --> 01:19:04.990
- I think this one is heavy. - 20g.

2278
01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:06.525
- It weighs 20g. - 20g.

2279
01:19:06.525 --> 01:19:10.195
Ji Hyo, put the second piece on the scale.

2280
01:19:11.530 --> 01:19:15.134
(Everything depends on the weight of the second half of her egg.)

2281
01:19:15.134 --> 01:19:17.369
If Ji Hyo wins, we will move on to the final round. Ji Hyo.

2282
01:19:17.369 --> 01:19:19.104
Let's go.

2283
01:19:19.271 --> 01:19:21.373
(What's the weight of the 2nd half of Ji Hyo's egg?)

2284
01:19:21.373 --> 01:19:23.208
Put the second piece on a scale.

2285
01:19:25.644 --> 01:19:26.879
20g. The difference is 2g.

2286
01:19:26.879 --> 01:19:27.880
- The difference is 2g. - We won.

2287
01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:29.081
She really is incredible.

2288
01:19:29.081 --> 01:19:31.750
(Ji Hyo really is incredible.)

2289
01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:33.786
If we win, we will have another round.

2290
01:19:33.786 --> 01:19:35.754
We won't be able to beat 2g.

2291
01:19:35.754 --> 01:19:37.122
You never know.

2292
01:19:37.122 --> 01:19:38.924
2g is...

2293
01:19:39.191 --> 01:19:42.795
(The 2nd half of Jong Kook's egg gets weighed.)

2294
01:19:42.795 --> 01:19:47.266
(If the difference is within 2g, Jong Kook will win.)

2295
01:19:47.266 --> 01:19:52.204
(What's the weight of the 2nd half of Jong Kook's egg?)

2296
01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:57.743
- What? It weighs 20g. - It weighs 20g.

2297
01:19:57.743 --> 01:19:59.344
20g.

2298
01:19:59.344 --> 01:20:02.080
20g! 20g!

2299
01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:04.316
(He cut it exactly in half.)

2300
01:20:04.449 --> 01:20:06.919
(The difference is 0g.)

2301
01:20:07.486 --> 01:20:09.154
We did it.

2302
01:20:09.154 --> 01:20:10.222
This is incredible.

2303
01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:12.424
(They can't help but admit defeat.)

2304
01:20:12.424 --> 01:20:14.226
We admit defeat.

2305
01:20:14.226 --> 01:20:15.961
- This is incredible. - My goodness.

2306
01:20:15.961 --> 01:20:18.363
The yolk on the knife did it.

2307
01:20:18.363 --> 01:20:20.833
- Seriously. - The yolk on the knife did it.

2308
01:20:20.833 --> 01:20:24.002
- We would have lost otherwise. - Seriously.

2309
01:20:24.069 --> 01:20:26.305
How is this possible?

2310
01:20:26.505 --> 01:20:27.806
We won two points.

2311
01:20:27.806 --> 01:20:28.941
(Team Champion gets 2 points.)

2312
01:20:28.941 --> 01:20:30.442
I can't believe it.

2313
01:20:30.442 --> 01:20:32.511
- How can it weigh 20g? - We admit defeat.

2314
01:20:32.511 --> 01:20:34.046
(The final score is 4 to 1.)

2315
01:20:34.046 --> 01:20:37.616
Team Champion gets five slots...

2316
01:20:37.616 --> 01:20:39.451
- and Team Ace gets one slot. - That's enough.

2317
01:20:39.451 --> 01:20:42.020
- Our chance is about the same. - It's enough.

2318
01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:45.390
- It's enough. - Team Ace has 10 slots...

2319
01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:46.792
and Team Champion has eight slots in total.

2320
01:20:46.792 --> 01:20:48.460
- Okay. We have more slots. - Our chance is about the same.

2321
01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:51.029
- It's enough. - We can do this.

2322
01:20:51.029 --> 01:20:52.331
It depends on luck.

2323
01:20:52.331 --> 01:20:54.333
Between the Ace and Champion, who will win?

2324
01:20:54.333 --> 01:20:56.235
I am curious about the result.

2325
01:20:56.235 --> 01:20:58.203
Who will be luckier?

2326
01:20:59.071 --> 01:21:00.439
The numbers are about the same, so let's take turns.

2327
01:21:00.439 --> 01:21:01.540
Okay.

2328
01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:03.876
(They fill up the slots on the final roulette.)

2329
01:21:03.876 --> 01:21:05.844
One slot at a time.

2330
01:21:06.111 --> 01:21:08.881
Between the Ace and Champion, who will win?

2331
01:21:08.881 --> 01:21:10.315
I am curious about the result.

2332
01:21:10.315 --> 01:21:11.850
Who will be luckier?

2333
01:21:11.850 --> 01:21:15.554
Ji Hyo is better with roulettes.

2334
01:21:15.554 --> 01:21:16.688
(Will it be Ji Hyo or Jong Kook?)

2335
01:21:16.688 --> 01:21:18.991
I am so nervous. I am so nervous.

2336
01:21:18.991 --> 01:21:20.826
- Okay. - There is no way of knowing.

2337
01:21:20.826 --> 01:21:22.261
Let's have three consecutive slots.

2338
01:21:22.261 --> 01:21:23.395
Gosh, that's...

2339
01:21:23.395 --> 01:21:25.030
That won't make us lose.

2340
01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:26.632
That might make us lose.

2341
01:21:26.632 --> 01:21:27.766
It will be incredible if it stops there.

2342
01:21:27.766 --> 01:21:29.301
- Goodness. - Okay.

2343
01:21:29.301 --> 01:21:31.503
I hope it stops at the three consecutive slots.

2344
01:21:31.503 --> 01:21:33.272
- It's a single take. - It's a single take, right?

2345
01:21:33.272 --> 01:21:34.373
- Spin it together. - Spin it together.

2346
01:21:34.373 --> 01:21:36.041
One should spin upward, and the other should spin downward.

2347
01:21:36.041 --> 01:21:37.676
Spin downward. I will spin upward.

2348
01:21:37.676 --> 01:21:39.478
Should I spin downward?

2349
01:21:39.811 --> 01:21:42.314
(How romantic!)

2350
01:21:42.581 --> 01:21:45.083
- What are you doing? - For goodness' sake.

2351
01:21:45.384 --> 01:21:47.786
- I will spin downward. - Spin downward. I will spin upward.

2352
01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:50.255
We get excited about the smallest things.

2353
01:21:50.255 --> 01:21:51.456
One.

2354
01:21:51.456 --> 01:21:53.558
(They still need to discern the winner.)

2355
01:21:53.558 --> 01:21:54.559
Two.

2356
01:21:54.559 --> 01:21:55.594
(The final round of Ace versus the Champion)

2357
01:21:55.594 --> 01:21:57.696
- Three. - Here it goes.

2358
01:21:57.696 --> 01:22:00.766
(They spun the final roulette together.)

2359
01:22:00.866 --> 01:22:01.900
Here it goes.

2360
01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:03.335
(Who will be chosen as the winner by the spirit of roulette?)

2361
01:22:03.335 --> 01:22:05.504
- I'm curious about the result. - I'm curious.

2362
01:22:05.504 --> 01:22:07.306
(Who will be chosen as the winner by the spirit of roulette?)

2363
01:22:08.073 --> 01:22:09.875
Ji Hyo. Ji Hyo.

2364
01:22:09.875 --> 01:22:11.243
- The three consecutive slots. - Ji Hyo.

2365
01:22:11.243 --> 01:22:12.511
(The roulette slows down.)

2366
01:22:12.511 --> 01:22:15.580
(Will the three consecutive slots be effective?)

2367
01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:17.549
- The three consecutive slots. - Ji Hyo.

2368
01:22:18.050 --> 01:22:21.086
(It passes Ji Hyo's three consecutive slots...)

2369
01:22:21.086 --> 01:22:24.856
(and goes towards the mixed slots.)

2370
01:22:24.856 --> 01:22:27.059
- The three consecutive slots. - Ji Hyo.

2371
01:22:27.059 --> 01:22:28.961
Ji Hyo, Ji Hyo. Will it go past this slot?

2372
01:22:28.961 --> 01:22:32.431
(It stops at Song Ji Hyo.)

2373
01:22:32.431 --> 01:22:35.000
Ji Hyo, Ji Hyo. Will it go past this slot?

2374
01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:38.136
(Team Ace wins.)

2375
01:22:38.136 --> 01:22:39.271
She is incredible.

2376
01:22:39.271 --> 01:22:40.539
(Ji Hyo always wins.)

2377
01:22:40.539 --> 01:22:41.840
She is incredible.

2378
01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:44.209
- Ji Hyo. - What is your deal?

2379
01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:47.145
I will sleep in LA!

2380
01:22:47.379 --> 01:22:49.414
(Ji Hyo is at the level to go to LA to sleep.)

2381
01:22:49.414 --> 01:22:51.550
- Ji Hyo is amazing. - Will you go there to sleep?

2382
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:52.784
(I give honor to my team.)

2383
01:22:52.784 --> 01:22:53.919
This is incredible.

2384
01:22:53.919 --> 01:22:55.520
The Champion lost to Ace.

2385
01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:56.922
Ace is the best.

2386
01:22:56.922 --> 01:22:57.923
- She is the best at roulette. - You can't win...

2387
01:22:57.923 --> 01:23:00.392
- against Ace. - Ace is the best.

2388
01:23:00.392 --> 01:23:01.960
You are so lucky, Ji Hyo.

2389
01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:04.796
I was hoping that Jong Kook would go on a trip.

2390
01:23:04.963 --> 01:23:07.265
The roulette chose her.

2391
01:23:07.265 --> 01:23:09.434
The true ace, Song Ji Hyo!

2392
01:23:09.434 --> 01:23:10.769
(The true ace, Song Ji Hyo)

2393
01:23:10.769 --> 01:23:13.805
- I want her luck. - Seriously.

2394
01:23:13.972 --> 01:23:15.774
She is incredible.
